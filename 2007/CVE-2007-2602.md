### Description

Buffer overflow in MIBEXTRA.EXE in Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code via a long MIB filename argument.  NOTE: If there is not a common scenario under which MIBEXTRA.EXE is called with attacker-controlled command line arguments, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
