### Description

Apache Tomcat 5.5.11 through 5.5.25 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.15, when the native APR connector is used, does not properly handle an empty request to the SSL port, which allows remote attackers to trigger handling of "a duplicate copy of one of the recent requests," as demonstrated by using netcat to send the empty request.
