### Description

** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in phpContact allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the include_path parameter to (1) contact_business.php or (2) contact_person.php.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE and a reliable third party, because include_path is initialized to a fixed value before use.
