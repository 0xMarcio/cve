### Description

ELinks before 0.11.3, when sending a POST request for an https URL, appends the body and content headers of the POST request to the CONNECT request in cleartext, which allows remote attackers to sniff sensitive data that would have been protected by TLS.  NOTE: this issue only occurs when a proxy is defined for https.
