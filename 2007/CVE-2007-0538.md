### Description

Telligent Community Server 2.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (bandwidth or thread consumption) via pingback service calls with a source URI that corresponds to (1) a large file, which triggers a long download session without a timeout constraint; or (2) a file with a binary content type, which is downloaded even though it cannot contain usable pingback data.
