### Description

** DISPUTED **  Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and 7.0 allows remote attackers to fill Zones with arbitrary domains using certain metacharacters such as wildcards via JavaScript, which results in a denial of service (website suppression and resource consumption), aka "Internet Explorer Zone Domain Specification Dos and Page Suppressing".  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the zone settings cannot be manipulated.
