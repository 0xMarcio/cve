### Description

ZyXEL Prestige routers, including P-660, P-661, and P-662 models with firmware 3.40(AGD.2) through 3.40(AHQ.3), allow remote authenticated users to obtain authentication data by making direct HTTP requests and then reading the HTML source, as demonstrated by a request for (1) RemMagSNMP.html, which discloses SNMP communities; or (2) WLAN.html, which discloses WEP keys.
