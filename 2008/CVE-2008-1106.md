### Description

The management interface in Akamai Client (formerly Red Swoosh) 3322 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an HTTP request that contains (1) no Referer header, or (2) a spoofed Referer header that matches an approved domain, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and force the client to download and execute arbitrary files.
