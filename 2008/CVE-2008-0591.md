### Description

Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.12 and Thunderbird before 2.0.0.12 does not properly manage a delay timer used in confirmation dialogs, which might allow remote attackers to trick users into confirming an unsafe action, such as remote file execution, by using a timer to change the window focus, aka the "dialog refocus bug" or "ffclick2".
