### Description

The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 and an invalid write of size 1 during processing of a corrupt binary containing reloc(s) with negative addresses. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.
