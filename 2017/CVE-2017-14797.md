### Description

Lack of Transport Encryption in the public API in Philips Hue Bridge BSB002 SW 1707040932 allows remote attackers to read API keys (and consequently bypass the pushlink protection mechanism, and obtain complete control of the connected accessories) by leveraging the ability to sniff HTTP traffic on the local intranet network.
