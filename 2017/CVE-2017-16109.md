### Description

easyquick is a simple web server. easyquick is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue, giving an attacker access to the filesystem by placing "../" in the url. Access is constrained, however, to supported file types. Requesting a file such as /etc/passwd returns a "not supported" error.
