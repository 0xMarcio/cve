### Description

The Spiceworks TFTP Server, as distributed with Spiceworks Inventory 7.5, allows remote attackers to access the Spiceworks data\configurations directory by leveraging the unauthenticated nature of the TFTP service for all clients who can reach UDP port 69, as demonstrated by a WRQ (aka Write request) operation for a configuration file or an executable file.
