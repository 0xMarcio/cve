### Description

The sh_elf_set_mach_from_flags function in bfd/elf32-sh.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
