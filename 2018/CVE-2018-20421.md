### Description

Go Ethereum (aka geth) 1.8.19 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by rewriting the length of a dynamic array in memory, and then writing data to a single memory location with a large index number, as demonstrated by use of "assembly { mstore }" followed by a "c[0xC800000] = 0xFF" assignment.
