### Description

An issue was discovered on AXIS M1033-W (IP camera) Firmware version 5.40.5.1 devices. They don't employ a suitable mechanism to prevent a DoS attack, which leads to a response time delay. An attacker can use the hping3 tool to perform an IPv4 flood attack, and the services are interrupted from attack start to end.
