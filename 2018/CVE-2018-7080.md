### Description

A vulnerability exists in the firmware of embedded BLE radios that are part of some Aruba Access points. An attacker who is able to exploit the vulnerability could install new, potentially malicious firmware into the AP's BLE radio and could then gain access to the AP's console port. This vulnerability is applicable only if the BLE radio has been enabled in affected access points. The BLE radio is disabled by default. Note - Aruba products are NOT affected by a similar vulnerability being tracked as CVE-2018-16986.
