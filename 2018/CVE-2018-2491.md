### Description

When opening a deep link URL in SAP Fiori Client with log level set to "Debug", the client application logs the URL to the log file. If this URL contains malicious JavaScript code it can eventually run inside the built-in log viewer of the application in case user opens the viewer and taps on the hyperlink in the viewer. SAP Fiori Client version 1.11.5 in Google Play store addresses these issues and users must update to that version.
