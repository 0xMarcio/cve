### Description

Arris Touchstone Telephony Gateway TG1682G 9.1.103J6 devices are distributed by some ISPs with a default password of "password" for the admin account that is used over an unencrypted http://192.168.0.1 connection, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging access to the local network. NOTE: one or more user's guides distributed by ISPs state "At a minimum, you should set a login password."
