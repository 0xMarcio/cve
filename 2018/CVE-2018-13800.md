### Description

A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family version 4 (All versions < V4.2.3). The web interface could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by a legitimate user, who must be authenticated to the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface that the legitimate user is allowed to perform. This could allow the attacker to read or modify parts of the device configuration.
