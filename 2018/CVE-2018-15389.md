### Description

A vulnerability in the install function of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the administrative web interface using a default hard-coded username and password that are used during install. The vulnerability is due to a hard-coded password that, in some cases, is not replaced with a unique password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the administrative web interface with administrator-level privileges.
