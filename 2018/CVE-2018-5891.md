### Description

While processing modem SSR after IMS is registered, the IMS data daemon is restarted but the ipc_dataHandle is no longer available. Consequently, the DPL thread frees the internal memory for dataDHandle but the local variable pointer is not updated which can lead to a Use After Free condition in Snapdragon Mobile and Snapdragon Wear.
