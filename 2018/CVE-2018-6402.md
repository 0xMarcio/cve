### Description

Ecobee Ecobee4 4.2.0.171 devices can be forced to deauthenticate and connect to an unencrypted Wi-Fi network with the same SSID, even if the device settings specify use of encryption such as WPA2, as long as the competing network has a stronger signal. An attacker must be able to set up a nearby SSID, similar to an "Evil Twin" attack.
