### Description

In Foxit Reader SDK (ActiveX) Professional 5.4.0.1031, an uninitialized object in IReader_ContentProvider::GetDocEventHandler occurs when embedding the control into Office documents. By opening a specially crafted document, an attacker can trigger an out of bounds write condition, possibly leveraging this to gain remote code execution.
