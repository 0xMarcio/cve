### Description

** DISPUTED ** OctoPrint through 1.3.9 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service via HTTP requests on port 8081. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report because their documentation states that with "blind port forwarding ... Putting OctoPrint onto the public internet is a terrible idea, and I really can't emphasize that enough."
