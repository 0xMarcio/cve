### Description

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.0.0.29935. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the Texture Width in U3D files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated object.
