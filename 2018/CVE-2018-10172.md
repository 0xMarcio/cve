### Description

** DISPUTED ** 7-Zip through 18.01 on Windows implements the "Large memory pages" option by calling the LsaAddAccountRights function to add the SeLockMemoryPrivilege privilege to the user's account, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using this privilege in the context of a sandboxed process. Note: This has been disputed by 3rd parties who argue this is a valid feature of Windows.
