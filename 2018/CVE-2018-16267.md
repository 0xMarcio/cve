### Description

The system-popup system service in Tizen allows an unprivileged process to perform popup-related system actions, due to improper D-Bus security policy configurations. Such actions include the triggering system poweroff menu, and prompting a popup with arbitrary strings. This affects Tizen before 5.0 M1, and Tizen-based firmwares including Samsung Galaxy Gear series before build RE2.
