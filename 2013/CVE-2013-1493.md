### Description

The color management (CMM) functionality in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 15 and earlier, 6 Update 41 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 40 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (crash) via an image with crafted raster parameters, which triggers (1) an out-of-bounds read or (2) memory corruption in the JVM, as exploited in the wild in February 2013.
