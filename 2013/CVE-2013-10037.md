### Description

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in WebTester version 5.x via the install2.php installation script. The parameters cpusername, cppassword, and cpdomain are passed directly to shell commands without sanitization. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by sending a crafted HTTP POST request, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the underlying system with web server privileges.
