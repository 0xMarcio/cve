### Description

Integer overflow in the fb_mmap function in drivers/video/fbmem.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.9, as used in a certain Motorola build of Android 4.1.2 and other products, allows local users to create a read-write memory mapping for the entirety of kernel memory, and consequently gain privileges, via crafted /dev/graphics/fb0 mmap2 system calls, as demonstrated by the Motochopper pwn program.
