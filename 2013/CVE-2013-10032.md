### Description

An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in GetSimpleCMS version 3.2.1. The applicationâ€™s upload.php endpoint allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation of MIME types or extensions. By uploading a .pht file containing PHP code, an attacker can bypass blacklist-based restrictions and place executable code within the web root. A crafted request using a polyglot or disguised extension allows the attacker to execute the payload by accessing the file directly via the web server. This vulnerability exists due to the use of a blacklist for filtering file types instead of a whitelist.
