### Description

The SDK for Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor, as used in Lavasoft Ad-Aware Web Companion 1.1.885.1766 and Ad-Aware AdBlocker (alpha) 1.3.69.1, Qustodio for Windows, Atom Security, Inc. StaffCop 5.8, and other products, uses the same X.509 certificate private key for a root CA certificate across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging knowledge of this key, as originally reported for Superfish VisualDiscovery on certain Lenovo Notebook laptop products.
