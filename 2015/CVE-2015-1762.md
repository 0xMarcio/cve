### Description

Microsoft SQL Server 2008 SP3 and SP4, 2008 R2 SP2 and SP3, 2012 SP1 and SP2, and 2014, when transactional replication is configured, does not prevent use of uninitialized memory in unspecified function calls, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging certain permissions and making a crafted query, as demonstrated by the VIEW SERVER STATE permission, aka "SQL Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
