### Description

Craft CMS through 3.7.36 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker, who knows at least one valid username, to reset the account's password and take over the account by providing a crafted HTTP header to the application while using the password reset functionality. Specifically, the attacker must send X-Forwarded-Host to the /index.php?p=admin/actions/users/send-password-reset-email URI. NOTE: the vendor's position is that a customer can already work around this by adjusting the configuration (i.e., by not using the default configuration).
