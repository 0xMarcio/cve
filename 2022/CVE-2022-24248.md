### Description

RiteCMS version 3.1.0 and below suffers from an arbitrary file deletion via path traversal vulnerability in Admin Panel. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to delete). Furthermore, an attacker might leverage the capability of arbitrary file deletion to circumvent certain web server security mechanisms such as deleting .htaccess file that would deactivate those security constraints.
