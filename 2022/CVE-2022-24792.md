### Description

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. A denial-of-service vulnerability affects applications on a 32-bit systems that use PJSIP versions 2.12 and prior to play/read invalid WAV files. The vulnerability occurs when reading WAV file data chunks with length greater than 31-bit integers. The vulnerability does not affect 64-bit apps and should not affect apps that only plays trusted WAV files. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/project` GitHub repository. As a workaround, apps can reject a WAV file received from an unknown source or validate the file first.
