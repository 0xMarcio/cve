### Description

The Multivendor Marketplace Solution for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 3.8.12 is lacking authorisation and CSRF in multiple AJAX actions, which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to call them and suspend vendors (reporter by the submitter) or update arbitrary order status (identified by WPScan when verifying the issue) for example. Other unauthenticated attacks are also possible, either directly or via CSRF
