### Description

Reflected XSS on demo.microweber.org/demo/module/ in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.2.15. Execute Arbitrary JavaScript as the attacked user. It's the only payload I found working, you might need to press "tab" but there is probably a paylaod that runs without user interaction.
