### Description

py-cord is a an API wrapper for Discord written in Python. Bots creating using py-cord version 2.0.0 are vulnerable to remote shutdown if they are added to the server with the `application.commands` scope without the `bot` scope. Currently, it appears that all public bots that use slash commands are affected. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.1. There are currently no recommended workarounds - please upgrade to a patched version.
