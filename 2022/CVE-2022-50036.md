### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/sun4i: dsi: Prevent underflow when computing packet sizesCurrently, the packet overhead is subtracted using unsigned arithmetic.With a short sync pulse, this could underflow and wrap around to nearthe maximal u16 value. Fix this by using signed subtraction. The call tomax() will correctly handle any negative numbers that are produced.Apply the same fix to the other timings, even though those subtractionsare less likely to underflow.
