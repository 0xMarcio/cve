### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sfc: fix TX channel offset when using legacy interruptsIn legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, butthat's not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case,the offset is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channelat index 0, together with the rx queue.Without this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, it tries toget the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/tx.c:540 efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]  [...]  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x12e/0x170 [sfc]  [...]  Call Trace:   <IRQ>   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230   sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360   __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40  [...]  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020  [...]  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]  [...]  Call Trace:   <IRQ>   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xd7/0x230   sch_direct_xmit+0x9f/0x360   __dev_queue_xmit+0x890/0xa40  [...]
