### Description

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v031. An Observable Response Discrepancy can occur under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/user/isenableuser endpoint, the /api/v1/sharedsearch?search={NAME]+{SURNAME] endpoint, and the /login endpoint. The web application provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.
