### Description

Incomplete fix for CVE-2021-3101. Hotdog, prior to v1.0.2, did not mimic the resource limits, device restrictions, or syscall filters of the target JVM process. This would allow a container to exhaust the resources of the host, modify devices, or make syscalls that would otherwise be blocked.
