### Description

The OAuth Client by DigitialPixies WordPress plugin through 1.1.0 does not sanitize and escapes some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example, in multisite setup).
