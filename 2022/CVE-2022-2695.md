### Description

The Beaver Builder â€“ WordPress Page Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'caption' parameter added to images via the media uploader in versions up to, and including, 2.5.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with access to the Beaver Builder editor and the ability to upload media files to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
