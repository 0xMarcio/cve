### Description

All versions of package gitpython are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments.
