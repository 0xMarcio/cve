### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/i915/gt: Cleanup partial engine discovery failuresIf we abort driver initialisation in the middle of gt/engine discovery,some engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely setupengines only have 'engine->release == NULL' and so will leak any of thecommon objects allocated.v2: - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now.  It's not really   worth it with just a single callsite at the moment.  (Janusz)
