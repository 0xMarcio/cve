### Description

An XSS issue was discovered on Olivetti d-COLOR MF3555 2XD_S000.002.271 devices. The Web Application doesn't properly check parameters, sent in a /dvcset/sysset/set.cgi POST request via the arg01.Hostname field, before saving them on the server. In addition, the JavaScript malicious content is then reflected back to the end user and executed by the web browser.
