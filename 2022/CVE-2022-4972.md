### Description

The Download Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several REST-API routes related to reporting in versions up to, and including, 4.7.51. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view user data and other sensitive information intended for administrators.
