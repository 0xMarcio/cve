### Description

Under certain conditions an attacker authenticated as a CMS administrator access the BOE Commentary database and retrieve (non-personal) system data, modify system data but can't make the system unavailable. This needs the attacker to have high privilege access to the same physical/logical network to access information which would otherwise be restricted, leading to low impact on confidentiality and high impact on integrity of the application.
