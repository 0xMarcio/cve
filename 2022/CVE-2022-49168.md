### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: do not clean up repair bio if submit failsThe submit helper will always run bio_endio() on the bio if it fails tosubmit, so cleaning up the bio just leads to a variety of use-after-freeand NULL pointer dereference bugs because we race with the endiofunction that is cleaning up the bio.  Instead just return BLK_STS_OK asthe repair function has to continue to process the rest of the pages,and the endio for the repair bio will do the appropriate cleanup for thepage that it was given.
