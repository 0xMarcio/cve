### Description

An issue was discovered in the Arm Mali GPU Kernel Driver. A non-privileged user can make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory, write a limited amount outside of buffer bounds, or to disclose details of memory mappings. This affects Midgard r4p0 through r32p0, Bifrost r0p0 through r38p0 and r39p0 before r38p1, and Valhall r19p0 through r38p0 and r39p0 before r38p1.
