### Description

A heap-based-buffer-over-read flaw was found in ImageMagick's GetPixelAlpha() function of 'pixel-accessor.h'. This vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image to convert it into a PICON file format. This issue can potentially lead to a denial of service and information disclosure.
