### Description

The Data Tables Generator by Supsystic WordPress plugin before 1.10.20 does not sanitise and escape some of its Table settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
