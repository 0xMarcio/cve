### Description

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication for SAML Users can occur under the /login/backup_code endpoint and the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. The correctness of the TOTP is not checked properly, and can be bypassed by passing any string as the backup code.
