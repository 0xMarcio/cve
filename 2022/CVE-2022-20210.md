### Description

The UE and the EMM communicate with each other using NAS messages. When a new NAS message arrives from the EMM, the modem parses it and fills in internal objects based on the received data. A bug in the parsing code could be used by an attacker to remotely crash the modem, which could lead to DoS or RCE.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-228868888
