### Description

The implementation of backslash parsing in the Dart URI class for versions prior to 2.18 and Flutter versions prior to 3.30 differs from the WhatWG URL standards. Dart uses the RFC 3986 syntax, which creates incompatibilities with the '\' characters in URIs, which can lead to auth bypass in webapps interpreting URIs. We recommend updating Dart or Flutter to mitigate the issue.
