### Description

FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including 1.46.16 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to an improper access restriction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by sending a URI that contains directory traversal characters to disclose the contents of files located outside of the server's restricted path.
