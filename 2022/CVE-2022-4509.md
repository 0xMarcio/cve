### Description

The Content Control WordPress plugin before 1.1.10 does not validate and escapes some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a role as low as a contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks, which could be used against high privilege users such as admins.
