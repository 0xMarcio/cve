### Description

GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique. GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. External links are not properly sanitized and can therefore be used for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to GLPI 10.0.4. There are currently no known workarounds.
