### Description

A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Ghostscript, which occurs when it tries to render a large number of bits in memory. When allocating a buffer device, it relies on an init_device_procs defined for the device that uses it as a prototype that depends upon the number of bits per pixel. For bpp > 64, mem_x_device is used and does not have an init_device_procs defined. This flaw allows an attacker to parse a large number of bits (more than 64 bits per pixel), which triggers a NULL pointer dereference flaw, causing an application to crash.
