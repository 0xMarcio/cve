### Description

Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 allow remote attackers to obtain the URI to any uploaded file by capturing the POST response. When chained with CVE-2022-24984, this could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution on the underlying web server. This occurs because the Unique ID field is contained in the POST response upon submitting a form.
