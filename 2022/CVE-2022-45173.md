### Description

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication can occur under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. Because only the client-side verifies whether a check was successful, an attacker can modify the response, and fool the application into concluding that the TOTP was correct.
