### Description

The 3dprint WordPress plugin before 3.5.6.9 does not protect against CSRF attacks in the modified version of Tiny File Manager included with the plugin, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request that will delete any number of files or directories on the target server by tricking a logged in admin into submitting a form.
