### Description

The RSVP and Event Management Plugin WordPress plugin before 2.7.8 does not have any authorisation checks when exporting its entries, and has the export function hooked to the init action. As a result, unauthenticated attackers could call it and retrieve PII such as first name, last name and email address of user registered for events
