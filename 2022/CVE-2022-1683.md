### Description

The amtyThumb WordPress plugin through 4.2.0 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via its shortcode, leading to an SQL injection and is exploitable by any authenticated user (and not just Author+ like the original advisory mention) due to the fact that they can execute shortcodes via an AJAX action
