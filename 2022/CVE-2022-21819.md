### Description

NVIDIA distributions of Jetson Linux contain a vulnerability where an error in the IOMMU configuration may allow an unprivileged attacker with physical access to the board direct read/write access to the entire system address space through the PCI bus. Such an attack could result in denial of service, code execution, escalation of privileges, and impact to data integrity and confidentiality. The scope impact may extend to other components.
