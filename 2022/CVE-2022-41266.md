### Description

Due to a lack of proper input validation, SAP Commerce Webservices 2.0 (Swagger UI) - versions 1905, 2005, 2105, 2011, 2205, allows malicious inputs from untrusted sources, which can be leveraged by an attacker to execute a DOM Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. As a result, an attacker may be able to steal user tokens and achieve a full account takeover including access to administrative tools in SAP Commerce.
