### Description

An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. When parsing a multi-gigabyte XML document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can overflow. This results in an attempt to access an array at a negative 2GB offset, typically leading to a segmentation fault.
