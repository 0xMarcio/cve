### Description

The Royal Elementor Addons WordPress plugin before 1.3.56 does not have authorization and CSRF checks when deleting a template and does not ensure that the post to be deleted is a template. This could allow any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to delete arbitrary posts assuming they know the related slug.
