### Description

The Google Places Reviews WordPress plugin before 2.0.0 does not properly escape its Google API key setting, which is reflected on the site's administration panel. A malicious administrator could abuse this bug, in a multisite WordPress configuration, to trick super-administrators into viewing the booby-trapped payload and taking over their account.
