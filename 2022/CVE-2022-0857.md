### Description

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in McAfee Enterprise ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) prior to 5.10 Update 13 allows a remote attacker to potentially obtain access to an ePO administrator's session by convincing the attacker to click on a carefully crafted link. This would lead to limited access to sensitive information and limited ability to alter some information in ePO due to the area of the User Interface the vulnerability is present in.
