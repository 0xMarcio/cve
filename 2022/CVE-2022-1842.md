### Description

The OpenBook Book Data WordPress plugin through 3.5.2 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack and lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping as well
