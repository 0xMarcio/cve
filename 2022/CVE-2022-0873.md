### Description

The Gmedia Photo Gallery WordPress plugin before 1.20.0 does not sanitise and escape the Album's name before outputting it in pages/posts with a media embed, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered-html capability is disallowed
