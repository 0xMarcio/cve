### Description

The package url-js before 2.1.0 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to improper parsing, which makes it is possible for the hostname to be spoofed. http://\\\\\\\\localhost and http://localhost are the same URL. However, the hostname is not parsed as localhost, and the backslash is reflected as it is.
