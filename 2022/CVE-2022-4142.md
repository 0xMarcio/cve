### Description

The WordPress Filter Gallery Plugin WordPress plugin before 0.1.6 does not properly escape the filters passed in the ufg_gallery_filters ajax action before outputting them on the page, allowing a high privileged user such as an administrator to inject HTML or javascript to the plugin settings page, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disabled.
