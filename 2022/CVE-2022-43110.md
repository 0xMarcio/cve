### Description

Voltronic Power ViewPower through 1.04-21353 and PowerShield Netguard before 1.04-23292 allows a remote attacker to configure the system via an unspecified web interface. An unauthenticated remote attacker can make changes to the system including: changing the web interface admin password, view/change system configuration, enumerate connected UPS devices and shut down connected UPS devices. This extends to being able to configure operating system commands that should run if the system detects a connected UPS shutting down.
