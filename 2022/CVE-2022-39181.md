### Description

GLPI - Reports plugin for GLPI Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (RXSS).Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back inthe HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to avulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The mostcommon mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or emailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, wherebyan attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's contentback to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.
