### Description

Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent operations can write past the end of the buffer.
