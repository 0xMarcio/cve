### Description

In Archibus Web Central before 26.2, multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities occur in dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr. Through the injection of arbitrary SQL statements, a potential attacker can modify query syntax and perform unauthorized (and unexpected) operations against the remote database. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.2.
