### Description

The postTabs WordPress plugin through 2.10.6 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack, which also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping
