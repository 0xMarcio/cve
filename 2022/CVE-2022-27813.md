### Description

Motorola MTM5000 series firmwares lack properly configured memory protection of pages shared between the OMAP-L138 ARM and DSP cores. The SoC provides two memory protection units, MPU1 and MPU2, to enforce the trust boundary between the two cores. Since both units are left unconfigured by the firmwares, an adversary with control over either core can trivially gain code execution on the other, by overwriting code located in shared RAM or DDR2 memory regions.
