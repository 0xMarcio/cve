### Description

If an on-premise installation of the Pega Platform is configured with the port for the JMX interface exposed to the Internet and port filtering is not properly configured, then it may be possible to upload serialized payloads to attack the underlying system. This does not affect systems running on PegaCloud due to its design and architecture.
