### Description

The Western Digital My Cloud Web App [https://os5.mycloud.com/] uses a weak SSLContext when attempting to configure port forwarding rules. This was enabled to maintain compatibility with old or outdated home routers. By using an "SSL" context instead of "TLS" or specifying stronger validation, deprecated or insecure protocols are permitted. As a result, a local user with no privileges can exploit this vulnerability and jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of information transmitted. The scope of impact cannot extend to other components and no user input is required to exploit this vulnerability.
