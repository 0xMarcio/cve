### Description

Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.3 relies on cleartext data transmission in some situations. It uses Keycloak for identity management services. During the sign-in process, Keycloak sets browser cookies that effectively provide remember-me functionality. For backwards compatibility with older Safari versions, Keycloak sets a duplicate of the cookie without the Secure attribute, which allows the cookie to be sent when accessing the location that cookie is set for via HTTP. This creates the potential for an attacker (with the ability to impersonate the Gradle Enterprise host) to capture the login session of a user by having them click an http:// link to the server, despite the real server requiring HTTPS.
