### Description

The Permalink Manager Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.20.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the extra_actions function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings including permalinks and site maps, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
