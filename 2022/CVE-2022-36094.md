### Description

XWiki Platform Web Parent POM contains Web resources for the XWiki platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 1.0 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.30-rc-1, it's possible to store JavaScript which will be executed by anyone viewing the history of an attachment containing javascript in its name. This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10.6 and 14.3RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to replace `viewattachrev.vm`, the entry point for this attack, by a patched version from the patch without updating XWiki.
