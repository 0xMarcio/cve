A vulnerability within the Avira Password Manager Browser Extensions provided a potential loophole where, if a user visited a page crafted by an attacker, the discovered vulnerability could trigger the Password Manager Extension to fill in the password field automatically. An attacker could then access this information via JavaScript. The issue was fixed with the browser extensions version 2.18.5 for Chrome, MS Edge, Opera, Firefox, and Safari.
