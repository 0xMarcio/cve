### Description

The Custom Post Types and Custom Fields creator WordPress plugin before 2.3.3 does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example, in multisite setup).
