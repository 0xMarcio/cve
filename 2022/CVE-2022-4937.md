### Description

The WCFM Frontend Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and access of data in versions up to, and including, 6.6.0 due to missing capability checks on various AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as subscribers, to perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying knowledge bases, modifying notices, modifying payments, managing vendors, capabilities, and so much more. There were hundreds of AJAX endpoints affected.
