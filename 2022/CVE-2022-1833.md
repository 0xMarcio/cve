### Description

A flaw was found in AMQ Broker Operator 7.9.4 installed via UI using OperatorHub where a low-privilege user that has access to the namespace where the AMQ Operator is deployed has access to clusterwide edit rights by checking the secrets. The service account used for building the Operator gives more permission than expected and an attacker could benefit from it. This requires at least an already compromised low-privilege account or insider attack.
