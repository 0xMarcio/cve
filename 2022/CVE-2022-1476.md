### Description

The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion via directory traversal due to insufficient file validation via the ~/lib/model/class-ai1wm-backups.php file, in versions up to, and including, 7.58. This can be exploited by administrative users, and users who have access to the site's secret key.
