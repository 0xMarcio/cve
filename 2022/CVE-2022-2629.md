### Description

The Top Bar WordPress plugin before 3.0.4 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings before outputting them in frontend pages, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
