### Description

The Random Banner WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the category parameter found in the ~/include/models/model.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.4. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.
