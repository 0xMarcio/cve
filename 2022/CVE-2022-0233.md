### Description

The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Memberships, Groups and Communities WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the pm_user_avatar and pm_cover_image parameters found in the ~/admin/class-profile-magic-admin.php file which allows attackers with authenticated user access, such as subscribers, to inject arbitrary web scripts into their profile, in versions up to and including 1.2.7.
