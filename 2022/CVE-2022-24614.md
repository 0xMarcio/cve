### Description

When reading a specially crafted JPEG file, metadata-extractor up to 2.16.0 can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out-of-memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use metadata-extractor library.
