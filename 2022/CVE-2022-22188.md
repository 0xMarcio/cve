### Description

An Uncontrolled Memory Allocation vulnerability leading to a Heap-based Buffer Overflow in the packet forwarding engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to flood the device with traffic leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The device must be configured with storm control profiling limiting the number of unknown broadcast, multicast, or unicast traffic to be vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5100/QFX5110/QFX5120/QFX5200/QFX5210/EX4600/EX4650 Series; 20.2 version 20.2R1 and later versions prior to 20.2R2.
