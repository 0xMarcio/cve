### Description

A particular case of memory sharing is mishandled in the virtual memory system.  This is very similar to SA-21:08.vm, but with a different root cause.An unprivileged local user process can maintain a mapping of a page after it is freed, allowing that process to read private data belonging to other processes or the kernel.
