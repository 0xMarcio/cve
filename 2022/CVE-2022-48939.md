### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Add schedule points in batch opssyzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations. INFO: task kworker/1:1:27 blocked for more than 140 seconds. INFO: task hung in rcu_barrierNothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data,we need to add schedule points in them.Note that maybe_wait_bpf_programs(map) calls fromgeneric_map_delete_batch() can be factorized by movingthe call after the loop.This will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged,unless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.
