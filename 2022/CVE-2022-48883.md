### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx5e: IPoIB, Block PKEY interfaces with less rx queues than parentA user is able to configure an arbitrary number of rx queues whencreating an interface via netlink. This doesn't work for child PKEYinterfaces because the child interface uses the parent receive channels.Although the child shares the parent's receive channels, the number ofrx queues is important for the channel_stats array: the parent's rxchannel index is used to access the child's channel_stats. So the arrayhas to be at least as large as the parent's rx queue size for thecounting to work correctly and to prevent out of bound accesses.This patch checks for the mentioned scenario and returns an error whentrying to create the interface. The error is propagated to the user.
