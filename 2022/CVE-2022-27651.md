![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Version&message=Affects%20buildah%20v1.24.0%20and%20prior%2C%20Fixed%20in%20-%20v1.25.0%20&color=brightgreen)
![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Vulnerability&message=CWE-276%20-%20Incorrect%20Default%20Permissions&color=brightgreen)

### Description

A flaw was found in buildah where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty default permissions. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, enabling an attacker with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set when execve(2) runs. This has the potential to impact confidentiality and integrity.
