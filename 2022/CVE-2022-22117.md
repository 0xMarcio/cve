### Description

In Directus, versions 9.0.0-alpha.4 through 9.4.1 allow unrestricted file upload of .html files in the media upload functionality, which leads to Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. A low privileged attacker can upload a crafted HTML file as a profile avatar, and when an admin or another user opens it, the XSS payload gets triggered.
