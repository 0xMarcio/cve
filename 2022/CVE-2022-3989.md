### Description

The Motors WordPress plugin before 1.4.4 does not properly validate uploaded files for dangerous file types (such as .php) in an AJAX action, allowing an attacker to sign up on a victim's WordPress instance, upload a malicious PHP file and attempt to launch a brute-force attack to discover the uploaded payload.
