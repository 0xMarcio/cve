### Description

The RB Internal Links WordPress plugin through 2.0.16 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack, as well as perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping
