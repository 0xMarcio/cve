### Description

A vulnerability in the VPN web client services component of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct browser-based attacks against users of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is passed to the VPN web client services component before being returned to the browser that is in use. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to visit a website that is designed to pass malicious requests to a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software and has web services endpoints supporting VPN features enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reflect malicious input from the affected device to the browser that is in use and conduct browser-based attacks, including cross-site scripting attacks. The attacker could not directly impact the affected device.
