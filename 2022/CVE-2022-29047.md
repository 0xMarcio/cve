### Description

Jenkins Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin 564.ve62a_4eb_b_e039 and earlier, except 2.21.3, allows attackers able to submit pull requests (or equivalent), but not able to commit directly to the configured SCM, to effectively change the Pipeline behavior by changing the definition of a dynamically retrieved library in their pull request, even if the Pipeline is configured to not trust them.
