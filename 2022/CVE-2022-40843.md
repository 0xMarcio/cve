### Description

The Tenda AC1200 V-W15Ev2 V15.11.0.10(1576) router is vulnerable to improper authorization / improper session management that allows the router login page to be bypassed. This leads to authenticated attackers having the ability to read the routers syslog.log file which contains the MD5 password of the Administrator's user account.
