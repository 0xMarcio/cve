### Description

Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop version 2.7.0.13 (and earlier) is affected by an Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must download a malicious DLL file. The attacker has to deliver the DLL on the same folder as the installer which makes it as a high complexity attack vector.
