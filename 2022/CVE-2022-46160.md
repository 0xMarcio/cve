### Description

Tuleap is an Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. In versions prior to 14.2.99.104, project level authorizations are not properly verified when accessing the project "homepage"/dashboards. Users not authorized to access a project may still be able to get some information provided by the widgets (e.g. number of members, content of the Notes widget...). This issue has been patched in Tuleap Community Edition 14.2.99.104, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.2-4, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.1-5.
