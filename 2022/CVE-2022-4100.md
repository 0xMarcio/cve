### Description

The WP Cerber Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Protection bypass in versions up to, and including 9.4 due to the plugin improperly checking for a visitor's IP address. This makes it possible for an attacker whose IP address has been blocked to bypass this control by setting the X-Forwarded-For: HTTP header to an IP Address that hasn't been blocked.
