### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: oss: Fix PCM OSS buffer allocation overflowWe've got syzbot reports hitting INT_MAX overflow at vmalloc()allocation that is called from snd_pcm_plug_alloc().  Although weapply the restrictions to input parameters, it's based only on thehw_params of the underlying PCM device.  Since the PCM OSS layerallocates a temporary buffer for the data conversion, the size maybecome unexpectedly large when more channels or higher rates is given;in the reported case, it went over INT_MAX, hence it hits WARN_ON().This patch is an attempt to avoid such an overflow and an allocationfor too large buffers.  First off, it adds the limit of 1MB as theupper bound for period bytes.  This must be large enough for all usecases, and we really don't want to handle a larger temporary bufferthan this size.  The size check is performed at two places, where theoriginal period bytes is calculated and where the plugin buffer sizeis calculated.In addition, the driver uses array_size() and array3_size() formultiplications to catch overflows for the converted period size andbuffer bytes.
