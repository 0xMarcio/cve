### Description

The Emerson ControlWave 'Next Generation' RTUs through 2022-05-02 mishandle firmware integrity. They utilize the BSAP-IP protocol to transmit firmware updates. Firmware updates are supplied as CAB archive files containing a binary firmware image. In all cases, firmware images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.
