### Description

An issue was discovered in BMC Remedy before 22.1. Email-based Incident Forwarding allows remote authenticated users to inject HTML (such as an SSRF payload) into the Activity Log by placing it in the To: field. This affects rendering that occurs upon a click in the "number of recipients" field. NOTE: the vendor's position is that "no real impact is demonstrated."
