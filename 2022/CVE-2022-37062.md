### Description

All FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including 1.46.16 are affected by an insecure design vulnerability due to an improper directory access restriction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by sending a URI that contains the path of the SQLite users database and download it. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to extract usernames and hashed passwords.
