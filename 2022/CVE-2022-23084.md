### Description

The total size of the user-provided nmreq to nmreq_copyin() was first computed and then trusted during the copyin.  This time-of-check to time-of-use bug could lead to kernel memory corruption.On systems configured to include netmap in their devfs_ruleset, a privileged process running in a jail can affect the host environment.
