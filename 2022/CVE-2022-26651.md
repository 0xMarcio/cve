### Description

An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x and Certified Asterisk through 16.8-cert13. The func_odbc module provides possibly inadequate escaping functionality for backslash characters in SQL queries, resulting in user-provided data creating a broken SQL query or possibly a SQL injection. This is fixed in 16.25.2, 18.11.2, and 19.3.2, and 16.8-cert14.
