### Description

Receipt of a malformed packet on MX Series devices with dynamic vlan configuration can trigger an uncontrolled recursion loop in the Broadband Edge subscriber management daemon (bbe-smgd), and lead to high CPU usage and a crash of the bbe-smgd service. Repeated receipt of the same packet can result in an extended denial of service condition for the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S1; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S7; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S10, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S1; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2.
