### Description

On Junos devices with the BGP graceful restart helper mode enabled or the BGP graceful restart mechanism enabled, a BGP session restart on a remote peer that has the graceful restart mechanism enabled may cause the local routing protocol daemon (RPD) process to crash and restart. By simulating a specific BGP session restart, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing prolonged denial of service (DoS). Graceful restart helper mode for BGP is enabled by default. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D48; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D92, 17.2X75-D102, 17.2X75-D110; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S4, 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2. Junos OS releases prior to 16.1R1 are not affected.
