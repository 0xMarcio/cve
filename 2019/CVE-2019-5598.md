### Description

In FreeBSD 11.3-PRERELEASE before r345378, 12.0-STABLE before r345377, 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p10, and 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p4, a bug in pf does not check if the outer ICMP or ICMP6 packet has the same destination IP as the source IP of the inner protocol packet allowing a maliciously crafted ICMP/ICMP6 packet could bypass the packet filter rules and be passed to a host that would otherwise be unavailable.
