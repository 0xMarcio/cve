![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Version&message=All%20versions%20of%20Apache%20CXF%20prior%20to%203.3.5%20and%203.2.12.%20&color=brightgreen)

### Description

By default, Apache CXF creates a /services page containing a listing of the available endpoint names and addresses. This webpage is vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which allows a malicious actor to inject javascript into the web page. Please note that the attack exploits a feature which is not typically not present in modern browsers, who remove dot segments before sending the request. However, Mobile applications may be vulnerable.
