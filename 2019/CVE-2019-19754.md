### Description

HiveOS through 0.6-102@191212 ships with SSH host keys baked into the installation image, which allows man-in-the-middle attacks and makes identification of all public IPv4 nodes trivial with Shodan.io. NOTE: as of 2019-09-26, the vendor indicated that they would consider fixing this.
