### Description

The Contact Form & SMTP Plugin by PirateForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML injection in the ‘public/class-pirateforms-public.php’ file in versions up to, and including, 2.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML in emails that could be used to phish unsuspecting victims.
