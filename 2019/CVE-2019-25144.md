### Description

The WP HTML Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML injection in versions up to, and including, 2.2.10 due to insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
