### Description

Insufficient checks in the finite state machine of the ShapeShift KeepKey hardware wallet before firmware 6.2.2 allow a partial reset of cryptographic secrets to known values via crafted messages. Notably, this breaks the security of U2F for new server registrations and invalidates existing registrations. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers and the interface is reachable via WebUSB.
