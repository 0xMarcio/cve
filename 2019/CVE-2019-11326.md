### Description

An issue was discovered on Topcon Positioning Net-G5 GNSS Receiver devices with firmware 5.2.2. The web interface of the product is protected by a login. A guest is allowed to login. Once logged in as a guest, an attacker can browse a URL to read the password of the administrative user. The same procedure allows a regular user to gain administrative privileges. The guest login is possible in the default configuration.
