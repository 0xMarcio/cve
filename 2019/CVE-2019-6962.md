### Description

A shell injection issue in cosa_wifi_apis.c in the RDK RDKB-20181217-1 CcspWifiAgent module allows attackers with login credentials to execute arbitrary shell commands under the CcspWifiSsp process (running as root) if the platform was compiled with the ENABLE_FEATURE_MESHWIFI macro. The attack is conducted by changing the Wi-Fi network password to include crafted escape characters. This is related to the WebUI module.
