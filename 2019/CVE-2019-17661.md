### Description

A CSV injection in the codepress-admin-columns (aka Admin Columns) plugin 3.4.6 for WordPress allows malicious users to gain remote control of other computers. By choosing formula code as his first or last name, an attacker can create a user with a name that contains malicious code. Other users might download this data as a CSV file and corrupt their PC by opening it in a tool such as Microsoft Excel. The attacker could gain remote access to the user's PC.
