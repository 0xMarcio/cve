### Description

rkt through version 1.30.0 does not isolate processes in containers that are run with `rkt enter`. Processes run with `rkt enter` do not have seccomp filtering during stage 2 (the actual environment in which the applications run). Compromised containers could exploit this flaw to access host resources.
