### Description

It was found that in ghostscript some privileged operators remained accessible from various places after the CVE-2019-6116 fix. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER. Ghostscript versions before 9.27 are vulnerable.
