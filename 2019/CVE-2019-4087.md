### Description

IBM Spectrum Protect Servers 7.1 and 8.1 and Storage Agents are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by servers and storage agents in response to specifically crafted communication exchanges. By sending an overly long request, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with instance id privileges or cause the server or storage agent to crash. IBM X-Force ID: 157510.
