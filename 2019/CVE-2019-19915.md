### Description

The "301 Redirects - Easy Redirect Manager" plugin before 2.45 for WordPress allows users (with subscriber or greater access) to modify, delete, or inject redirect rules, and exploit XSS, with the /admin-ajax.php?action=eps_redirect_save and /admin-ajax.php?action=eps_redirect_delete actions. This could result in a loss of site availability, malicious redirects, and user infections. This could also be exploited via CSRF.
