### Description

WebPageTest version 2.6 and earlier contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the resultimage.php script. The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before saving uploaded files to a publicly accessible directory. This flaw allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, resulting in full remote code execution under the web server context.
