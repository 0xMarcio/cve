### Description

CuteFlow version 2.11.2 and earlier contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the restart_circulation_values_write.php script. The application fails to validate or restrict uploaded file types, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to the upload/___1/ directory. These files are then accessible via the web server, enabling remote code execution.
