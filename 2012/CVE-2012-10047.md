### Description

Cyclope Employee Surveillance Solution versions 6.x is vulnerable to a SQL injection flaw in its login mechanism. The username parameter in the auth-login POST request is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL statements. This can be leveraged to write and execute a malicious PHP file on disk, resulting in remote code execution under the SYSTEM user context.
