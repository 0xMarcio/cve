### Description

McAfee Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) Agent before 4.8 and Server before 10.1, when one-time provisioning (OTP) mode is enabled, have an improper dependency on DNS SRV records, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover user passwords by spoofing the EMM server, as demonstrated by a password entered on an iOS device.
