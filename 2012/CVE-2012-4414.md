### Description

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the replication code in Oracle MySQL possibly before 5.5.29, and MariaDB 5.1.x through 5.1.62, 5.2.x through 5.2.12, 5.3.x through 5.3.7, and 5.5.x through 5.5.25, allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via vectors related to the binary log. NOTE: as of 20130116, Oracle has not commented on claims from a downstream vendor that the fix in MySQL 5.5.29 is incomplete.
