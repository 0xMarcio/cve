### Description

McAfee Email and Web Security (EWS) 5.x before 5.5 Patch 6 and 5.6 before Patch 3, and McAfee Email Gateway (MEG) 7.0 before Patch 1, does not disable the server-side session token upon the closing of the Management Console/Dashboard, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack sessions by capturing a session cookie and then modifying the response to a login attempt, related to a "Logout Failure" issue.
