### Description

FreeFloat FTP Server contains multiple critical design flaws that allow unauthenticated remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to sensitive system directories. The server accepts empty credentials, defaults user access to the root of the C:\ drive, and imposes no restrictions on file type or destination path. These conditions enable attackers to upload executable payloads and .mof files to locations such as system32 and wbem\mof, where Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) automatically processes and executes them. This results in remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges, without requiring user interaction.
