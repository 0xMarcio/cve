### Description

The TAR file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with an initial [aliases] character sequence. NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.
