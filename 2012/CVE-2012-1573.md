### Description

gnutls_cipher.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.12.17 and 3.x before 3.0.15 does not properly handle data encrypted with a block cipher, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted record, as demonstrated by a crafted GenericBlockCipher structure.
