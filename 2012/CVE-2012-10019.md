### Description

The Front End Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload.php file in versions before 2.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
