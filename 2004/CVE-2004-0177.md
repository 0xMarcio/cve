### Description

The ext3 code in Linux 2.4.x before 2.4.26 does not properly initialize journal descriptor blocks, which causes an information leak in which in-memory data is written to the device for the ext3 file system, which allows privileged users to obtain portions of kernel memory by reading the raw device.
