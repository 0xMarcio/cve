### Description

Zone Alarm Pro 1.0 through 5.1 gives full access to %windir%\Internet Logs\* to the EVERYONE group, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by modifying the folder contents or permissions. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who claims that it does not affect product functionality since the same information is also saved in a protected file
