### Description

Multiple integer overflows in (1) readbmp.c, (2) readgif.c, (3) readgif.c, (4) readmrf.c, (5) readpcx.c, (6) readpng.c,(7) readpnm.c, (8) readprf.c, (9) readtiff.c, (10) readxbm.c, (11) readxpm.c in zgv 5.8 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain image headers that cause calculations to be overflowed and small buffers to be allocated, leading to buffer overflows.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0994 and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of bugs that only partially overlap, despite having the same developer.  Therefore, they should be regarded as distinct.
