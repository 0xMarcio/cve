### Description

** DISPUTED **  The encapsulation script mechanism in Webwasher CSM Appliance Suite 5.x uses case-sensitive detection of malicious tokens, which allows attackers to bypass script detection by using tokens that can be upper or lower case.  NOTE: the vendor has stated that this problem could not be reproduced, and has asked the researcher for more information, without a response as of 20060103.
