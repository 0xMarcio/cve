### Description

Heap-based buffer overflow in the JPXStream::readCodestream function in the JPX stream parsing code (JPXStream.c) for xpdf 3.01 and earlier, as used in products such as (1) Poppler, (2) teTeX, (3) KDE kpdf, (4) CUPS, and (5) libextractor allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (heap corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file with large size values that cause insufficient memory to be allocated.
