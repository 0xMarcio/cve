### Description

Brocade SANnav before Brocade SANnav 2.4.0a could log database passwords in clear text in audit logs when the daily data dump collector invokes docker exec commands. These audit logs are the local server VMâ€™s audit logs and are not controlled by SANnav. These logs are only visible to the server admin of the host server and are not visible to the SANnav admin or any SANnav user.
