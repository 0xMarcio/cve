### Description

Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. Starting in version 0.0.1 and prior to 1.15.12, API_SET_SECURE_PARAM may have an arithmetic overflow deep in the memory allocation subsystem that would lead to a smaller allocation than requested, and a buffer overflow. Version 1.15.12 fixes the issue.
