### Description

The NewsBlogger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the newsblogger_install_and_activate_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 0.2.5.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
