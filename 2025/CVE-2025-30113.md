### Description

An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Hardcoded Credentials exist in the APK for Ports 9091 and 9092. The dashcam's Android application contains hardcoded credentials that allow unauthorized access to device settings through ports 9091 and 9092. These credentials, stored in cleartext, can be exploited by an attacker who gains access to the dashcam's network.
