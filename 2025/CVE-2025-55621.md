### Description

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Reolink v4.54.0.4.20250526 allows unauthorized attackers to access and download other users' profile photos via a crafted URL. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because it is intentional behavior; the photos are part of a social platform on which users expect to find one another.
