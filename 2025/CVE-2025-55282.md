### Description

aiven-db-migrate is an Aiven database migration tool. Prior to 1.0.7, there is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a user to elevate to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases during a migration from an untrusted source server. By exploiting a lack of search_path restriction, an attacker can override pg_catalog and execute untrusted operators as a superuser. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.7.
