### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ata: pata_via: Force PIO for ATAPI devices on VT6415/VT6330The controller has a hardware bug that can hard hang the system whendoing ATAPI DMAs without any trace of what happened. Depending on thedevice attached, it can also prevent the system from booting.In this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical mediawith cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and anOptiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,running at UDMA/33.The issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwinbuild of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to causeit. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn'tappear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no knownworkaround exists.HDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA issues.
