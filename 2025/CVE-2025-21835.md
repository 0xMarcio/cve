### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: f_midi: fix MIDI Streaming descriptor lengthsWhile the MIDI jacks are configured correctly, and the MIDIStreamingendpoint descriptors are filled with the correct information,bNumEmbMIDIJack and bLength are set incorrectly in these descriptors.This does not matter when the numbers of in and out ports are equal, butwhen they differ the host will receive broken descriptors withuninitialized stack memory leaking into the descriptor for whichevervalue is smaller.The precise meaning of "in" and "out" in the port counts is not clearlydefined and can be confusing.  But elsewhere the driver consistentlyuses this to match the USB meaning of IN and OUT viewed from the host,so that "in" ports send data to the host and "out" ports receive datafrom it.
