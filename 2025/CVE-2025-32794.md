### Description

OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions prior to 7.0.3.4 allows any authenticated user with patient creation privileges to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the system by entering malicious payloads in the First and Last Name fields during patient registration. This code is later executed when viewing the patient's encounter under Orders â†’ Procedure Orders. Version 7.0.3.4 contains a patch for the issue.
