### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ax25: properly unshare skbs in ax25_kiss_rcv()Bernard Pidoux reported a regression apparently caused by commitc353e8983e0d ("net: introduce per netns packet chains").skb->dev becomes NULL and we crash in __netif_receive_skb_core().Before above commit, different kind of bugs or corruptions could happenwithout a major crash.But the root cause is that ax25_kiss_rcv() can queue/mangle input skbwithout checking if this skb is shared or not.Many thanks to Bernard Pidoux for his help, diagnosis and tests.We had a similar issue years ago fixed with commit 7aaed57c5c28("phonet: properly unshare skbs in phonet_rcv()").
