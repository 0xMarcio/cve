### Description

Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt CO File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CO files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure.
