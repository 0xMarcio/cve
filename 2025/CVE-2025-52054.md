### Description

An issue was discovered in Tenda AC8 v4.0 AC1200 Dual-band Gigabit Wireless Router AC8v4.0 Firmware 16.03.33.05. The root password of the device is calculated with a static string and the last two octets of the MAC address of the device. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to authenticate with network services on the device.
