### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]Recent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data()when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attachedlinks), but we shouldn't.Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we may havemore in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0(no space, no data available) but with a warning.This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent stateand have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.
