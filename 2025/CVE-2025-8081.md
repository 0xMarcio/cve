### Description

The Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 3.30.2 via the Import_Images::import() function due to insufficient controls on the filename specified. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
