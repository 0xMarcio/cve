### Description

Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in Arm Ltd Bifrost GPU Userspace Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Userspace Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Userspace Driver allows a non-privileged user process to make valid GPU processing operations, including via WebGL or WebGPU, to access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds.This issue affects Bifrost GPU Userspace Driver: from r0p0 through r49p2, from r50p0 through r51p0; Valhall GPU Userspace Driver: from r19p0 through r49p2, from r50p0 through r53p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Userspace Driver: from r41p0 through r49p2, from r50p0 through r53p0.
