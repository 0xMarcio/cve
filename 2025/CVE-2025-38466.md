### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf: Revert to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for uprobesJann reports that uprobes can be used destructively when used in themiddle of an instruction. The kernel only verifies there is a validinstruction at the requested offset, but due to variable instructionlength cannot determine if this is an instruction as seen by theintended execution stream.Additionally, Mark Rutland notes that on architectures that mix datain the text segment (like arm64), a similar things can be done if thedata word is 'mistaken' for an instruction.As such, require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for uprobes.
