### Description

Sitecore Experience Manager (XM), Experience Platform (XP), and Experience Commerce (XC) versions 9.0 through 9.3 and 10.0 through 10.4 are affected by a Zip Slip vulnerability. A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this issue by sending a crafted HTTP request to upload a ZIP archive containing path traversal sequences, allowing arbitrary file writes and leading to code execution.
