### Description

During a target rollback, the client fails to detect the rollback for delegated targets. This could cause the client to fetch a target from an incorrect source, altering the target contents. Users should upgrade to tough version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.
