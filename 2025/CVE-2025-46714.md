### Description

Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. Starting in version 1.3.0 and prior to 1.15.12, API_GET_SECURE_PARAM has an arithmetic overflow leading to a small memory allocation and then a extremely large copy into the small allocation. Version 1.15.12 fixes the issue.
