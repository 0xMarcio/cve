An attacker with access to the Administration panel, specifically the "Role Management"tab, caninject code by adding a new role in the "name" field. It should be noted, however, that the risk of exploiting vulnerability is reduced due to therequired additional error that allows bypassing the Content-Security-Policy policy, whichmitigates JS code execution while still allowing HTML injection.This issue affects CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager in SaaS version 24.7.1. The status of other versions is unknown. After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer.
