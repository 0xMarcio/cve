### Description

Due to a missing authorization check in SAP Cloud Connector, an attacker on an adjacent network with low privileges could send a crafted request to the endpoint responsible for testing LDAP connections. A successful exploit could lead to reduced performance, hence a low-impact on availability of the service. Confidentiality and integrity of the data are not affected.
