### Description

WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.2.6. This vulnerability allows unauthorized scripts to be executed within the user's browser context. Stored XSS is particularly critical, as the malicious code is permanently stored on the server and executed whenever a compromised page is loaded, affecting all users accessing this page. Version 3.2.6 fixes the issue.
