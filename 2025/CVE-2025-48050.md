### Description

In DOMPurify through 3.2.5 before 6bc6d60, scripts/server.js does not ensure that a pathname is located under the current working directory. NOTE: the Supplier disputes the significance of this report because the "Uncontrolled data used in path expression" occurs "in a development helper script which starts a local web server if needed and must be manually started."
