### Description

A command injection vulnerability exists in LILIN Digital Video Recorder (DVR) devices prior to firmware version 2.0b60_20200207 due to insufficient sanitization of the FTP and NTP Server fields in the service configuration. An attacker with access to the configuration interface can upload a malicious XML file with injected shell commands in these fields. Upon subsequent configuration syncs, these commands are executed with elevated privileges. This vulnerability was exploited in the wild by the Moobot botnets.
