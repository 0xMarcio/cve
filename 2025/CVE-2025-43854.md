### Description

DIFY is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 1.3.0, a clickjacking vulnerability was found in the default setup of the DIFY application, allowing malicious actors to trick users into clicking on elements of the web page without their knowledge or consent. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed, potentially compromising the security and privacy of users. This issue has been fixed in version 1.3.0.
