### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:regulator: dummy: force synchronous probingSometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get()with the following call stack:anatop_regulator_probe() devm_regulator_register()  regulator_register()   regulator_resolve_supply()    kobject_get()By placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this israised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).In the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() andanatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads(kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can bechanged or if there are other possibilities to force synchronizationbetween these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect muchboot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.
