### Description

The Event Tickets and Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_ticket_delete' function in all versions up to, and including, 5.19.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary Attendee tickets.
