### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nilfs2: protect access to buffers with no active referencesnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers(), which iterates through the buffersattached to dirty data folios/pages, accesses the attached buffers withoutlocking the folios/pages.For data cache, nilfs_clear_folio_dirty() may be called asynchronouslywhen the file system degenerates to read only, sonilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() still has the potential to cause useafter free issues when buffers lose the protection of their dirty statemidway due to this asynchronous clearing and are unintentionally freed bytry_to_free_buffers().Eliminate this race issue by adjusting the lock section in this function.
