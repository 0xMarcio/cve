### Description

The MultiVendorX â€“ WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a misconfigured capability check on the 'delete_fpm_product' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.22. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary posts, pages, attachments, and products. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.2.22.
