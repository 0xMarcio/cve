### Description

The Make Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to misconfigured file type validation in the 'upload_media' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
