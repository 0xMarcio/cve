### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i3c: Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has notbeen probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()`to queue an IBI work task, leading to "Unable to handle kernel read fromunreadable memory" and resulting in a kernel panic.Typical IBI handling flow:1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers.2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI   and assigns `dev->ibi = ibi`.3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls   `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driverâ€™s IBI   handler task.However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probesequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev->ibi` to be `NULL`,leading to a kernel panic.Add a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessingan uninitialized `dev->ibi`, ensuring stability.
