### Description

Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. In the default configuration of mermaid 10.9.0-rc.1 to 11.9.0, user supplied input for sequence diagram labels is passed to innerHTML during calculation of element size, causing XSS.
