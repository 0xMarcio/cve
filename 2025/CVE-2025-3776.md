### Description

The Verification SMS with TargetSMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 via the 'targetvr_ajax_handler' function. This is due to a lack of validation on the type of function that can be called. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute any callable function on the site, such as phpinfo().
