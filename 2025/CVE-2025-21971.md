### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOTThe function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a terminationcondition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlogcounters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, thetraversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching theactual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.
