### Description

A backdoor in PHPStudy versions 2016 through 2018 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected installations. The backdoor listens for base64-encoded PHP payloads in the Accept-Charset HTTP header of incoming requests, decodes and executes the payload without proper validation. This leads to remote code execution as the web server user, compromising the affected system.
