This information include user ids, email addresses, first names, last names and device UUIDs. The last one can be used for exploitation of CVE-2025-1416.Successful exploitation requires UUID of a targeted backup, which cannot be brute forced.Â This issue has been fixed in 2.17.5 version of Konsola Proget (server part of the MDM suite).
