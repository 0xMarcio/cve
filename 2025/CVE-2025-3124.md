### Description

A missing authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a user to see the names of private repositories that they wouldn't otherwise have access to in the Security Overview in GitHub Advanced Security. The Security Overview was required to be filtered only using the `archived:` filter and all other access controls were functioning normally. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.17 and was fixed in versions 3.13.14, 3.14.11, 3.15.6, and 3.16.2.
