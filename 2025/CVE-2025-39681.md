### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/cpu/hygon: Add missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in bsp_init helperSince  923f3a2b48bd ("x86/resctrl: Query LLC monitoring properties once during boot")resctrl_cpu_detect() has been moved from common CPU initialization code tothe vendor-specific BSP init helper, while Hygon didn't put that call in theircode.This triggers a division by zero fault during early booting stage on ourmachines with X86_FEATURE_CQM* supported, where get_rdt_mon_resources() triesto calculate mon_l3_config with uninitialized boot_cpu_data.x86_cache_occ_scale.Add the missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in the Hygon BSP init helper.
