### Description

Cherry Studio is a desktop client that supports for multiple LLM providers. In version 1.5.1, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the Cherry Studio platform when connecting to streamableHttp MCP servers. The issue arises from the serverâ€™s implicit trust in the oauth auth redirection endpoints and failure to properly sanitize the URL. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.2.
