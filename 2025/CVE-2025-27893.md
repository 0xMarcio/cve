### Description

In Archer Platform 6 through 6.14.00202.10024, an authenticated user with record creation privileges can manipulate immutable fields, such as the creation date, by intercepting and modifying a Copy request via a GenericContent/Record.aspx?id= URI. NOTE: the Supplier analyzed the reported exploitation steps and found that, although the user can modify the immutable field, upon switching to View mode the field is reverted to its original value, without anything being saved to the database (and consequently there is no impact).
