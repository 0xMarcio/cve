### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *posksmbd_vfs_stream_write() did not validate whether the write offset(*pos) was within the bounds of the existing stream data length (v_len).If *pos was greater than or equal to v_len, this could lead to anout-of-bounds memory write.This patch adds a check to ensure *pos is less than v_len beforeproceeding. If the condition fails, -EINVAL is returned.
