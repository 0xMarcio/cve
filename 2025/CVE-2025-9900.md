### Description

A flaw was found in Libtiff. This vulnerability is a "write-what-where" condition, triggered when the library processes a specially crafted TIFF image file.By providing an abnormally large image height value in the file's metadata, an attacker can trick the library into writing attacker-controlled color data to an arbitrary memory location. This memory corruption can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) or to achieve arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user.
