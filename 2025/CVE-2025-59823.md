### Description

Project Gardener implements the automated management and operation of Kubernetes clusters as a service. Code injection may be possible in Gardener Extensions for AWS providers prior to version 1.64.0, Azure providers prior to version 1.55.0, OpenStack providers prior to version 1.49.0, and GCP providers prior to version 1.46.0. This vulnerability could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project to obtain control over the seed cluster where the shoot cluster is managed. This affects all Gardener installations where Terraformer is used/can be enabled for infrastructure provisioning with any of the affected components. This issue has been patched in Gardener Extensions for AWS providers version 1.64.0, Azure providers version 1.55.0, OpenStack providers version 1.49.0, and GCP providers version 1.46.0.
