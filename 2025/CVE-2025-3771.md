### Description

A path or symbolic link manipulation vulnerability in SIR 1.0.3 and prior versions allows an authenticated non-admin local user to overwrite system files with SIR backup files, which can potentially cause a system crash. This was achieved by adding a malicious entry to the registry under the Trellix SIR registry folder or via policy or with a junction symbolic link to files that the user would not normally have permission to acces
