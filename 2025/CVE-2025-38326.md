### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:aoe: clean device rq_list in aoedev_downdev()An aoe device's rq_list contains accepted block requests that arewaiting to be transmitted to the aoe target. This queue was added aspart of the conversion to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned outwhen an aoe device is downed which caused blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleepindefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing a hang. Thisfix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue().
