### Description

Para is a multitenant backend server/framework for object persistence and retrieval. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.50.8 exposes both access and secret keys in logs without redaction. These credentials are later reused in variable assignments for persistence but do not require logging for debugging or system health purposes. Version 1.50.8 fixes the issue.
