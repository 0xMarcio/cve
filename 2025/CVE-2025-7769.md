### Description

Tigo Energy's CCA is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability in the /cgi-bin/mobile_api endpoint when the DEVICE_PING command is called, allowing remote code execution due to improper handling of user input. When used with default credentials, this enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device that could cause potential unauthorized access, service disruption, and data exposure.
