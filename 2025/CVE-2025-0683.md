### Description

In its default configuration, Contec Health CMS8000 Patient Monitor transmits plain-text patient data to a hard-coded public IP address when a patient is hooked up to the monitor. This could lead to a leakage of confidential patient data to any device with that IP address or an attacker in a machine-in-the-middle scenario.
