### Description

OpenNebula Community Edition (CE) before 7.0.0 and Enterprise Edition (EE) before 6.10.3 have a critical FireEdge race condition that can lead to full account takeover. By exploiting this, an unauthenticated attacker can obtain a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) belonging to a legitimate user without knowledge of their credentials.
