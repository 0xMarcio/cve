### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:espintcp: remove encap socket caching to avoid reference leakThe current scheme for caching the encap socket can lead to referenceleaks when we try to delete the netns.The reference chain is: xfrm_state -> enacp_sk -> netnsSince the encap socket is a userspace socket, it holds a reference onthe netns. If we delete the espintcp state (through flush orindividual delete) before removing the netns, the reference on thesocket is dropped and the netns is correctly deleted. Otherwise, thenetns may not be reachable anymore (if all processes within the nshave terminated), so we cannot delete the xfrm state to drop itsreference on the socket.This patch results in a small (~2% in my tests) performanceregression.A GC-type mechanism could be added for the socket cache, to clearreferences if the state hasn't been used "recently", but it's a lotmore complex than just not caching the socket.
