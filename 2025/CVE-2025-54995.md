### Description

Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to versions 18.26.4 and 18.9-cert17, RTP UDP ports and internal resources can leak due to a lack of session termination. This could result in leaks and resource exhaustion. This issue has been patched in versions 18.26.4 and 18.9-cert17.
