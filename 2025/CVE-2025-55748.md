### Description

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In versions 4.2-milestone-2 through 16.10.6, configuration files are accessible through jsx and sx endpoints. It's possible to access and read configuration files by using URLs such as `http://localhost:8080/bin/ssx/Main/WebHome?resource=../../WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg&minify=false`. This is fixed in version 16.10.7.
