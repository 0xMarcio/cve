### Description

Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. From 10.8.0 to before 11.9.3, a vulnerability exists in the file update mechanism which allows an unauthenticated actor to modify existing files with arbitrary contents (without changes being applied to the files' database-resident metadata) and / or upload new files, with arbitrary content and extensions, which won't show up in the Directus UI. This vulnerability is fixed in 11.9.3.
