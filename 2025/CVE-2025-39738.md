### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: do not allow relocation of partially dropped subvolumes[BUG]There is an internal report that balance triggered transaction abort,with the following call trace:  item 85 key (594509824 169 0) itemoff 12599 itemsize 33          extent refs 1 gen 197740 flags 2          ref#0: tree block backref root 7  item 86 key (594558976 169 0) itemoff 12566 itemsize 33          extent refs 1 gen 197522 flags 2          ref#0: tree block backref root 7 ...

That explains why there is no backref item for thatbytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong.But this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphansubvolume cleanup at a read-write mount.So half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, andbalance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning weshouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation.The root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume.In fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the sameproblem.It looks like the original report has some older kernels running, andcaused those zombie subvolumes.Thankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 ("btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshotdeletion not triggered on mount") has long fixed the bug.[ENHANCEMENT]For repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced.Considering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed reftime) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is toolate.Instead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at theearliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debuggingsimilar bugs.
