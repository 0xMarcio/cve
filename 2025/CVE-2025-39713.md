### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()In the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check onrain->buf_len is performed before acquiring rain->buf_lock. Thiscreates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, asrain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the workhandler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_lenbefore it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to bothinterrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_lenbeyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.Fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer fullcheck. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modificationare performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An correspondingspin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release thelock.This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tooldeveloped by our team.
