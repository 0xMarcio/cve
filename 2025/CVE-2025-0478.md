### Description

Software installed and run as a non-privileged user may conduct improper GPU system calls to issue reads and writes to arbitrary physical memory pages.Under certain circumstances this exploit could be used to corrupt data pages not allocated by the GPU driver but memory pages in use by the kernel and drivers running on the platform, altering their behaviour.
