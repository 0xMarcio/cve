### Description

Gokapi is a self-hosted file sharing server with automatic expiration and encryption support. By renaming the friendly name of an API key, an authenticated user could inject JS into the API key overview, which would also be executed when another user clicks on his API tab. Prior to version 2.0.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users of versions prior to 2.0.0. If a user is the only authenticated user using Gokapi, they are not affected. This issue has been fixed in v2.0.0. A workaround would be to not open the API page if it is possible that another user might have injected code.
