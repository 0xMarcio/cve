### Description

GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.71 and prior to version 10.0.18, an anonymous user can fetch sensitive information from the `status.php` endpoint. Version 10.0.18 contains a fix for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may delete the `status.php` file, restrict its access, or remove any sensitive values from the `name` field of the active LDAP directories, mail servers authentication providers and mail receivers.
