### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net_sched: skbprio: Remove overly strict queue assertionsIn the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue contains an assertionthat fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child qdisc underTBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks atpackets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens areunavailable.This peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdiscqueue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,SKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in itsinternal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.The fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are notnecessary at all.
