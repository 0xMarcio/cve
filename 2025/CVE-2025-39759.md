### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctlThere's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running therescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records fromthe fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.This happens as follows:1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that   point fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by   task A);3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups   from fs_info->qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info->qgroup_lock;4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating   the fs_info->qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info->qgroup_lock,   but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding   the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.Fix this by taking fs_info->qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotaswere already disabled.
