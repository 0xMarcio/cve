### Description

The WP-Recall â€“ Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 via the 'feed' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
