### Description

A flaw was found in the Lightspeed history service. Insufficient access controls allow a local, unprivileged user to access and manipulate the chat history of another user on the same system. By abusing inter-process communication  calls to the history service, an attacker can view, delete, or inject arbitrary history entries, including misleading or malicious commands. This can be used to deceive another user into executing harmful actions, posing a risk of privilege misuse or unauthorized command execution through social engineering.
