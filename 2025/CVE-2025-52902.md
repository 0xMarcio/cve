### Description

File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. The Markdown preview function of File Browser prior to v2.33.7 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). Any JavaScript code that is part of a Markdown file uploaded by a user will be executed by the browser. Version 2.33.7 contains a fix for the issue.
