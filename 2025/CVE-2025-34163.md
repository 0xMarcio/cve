### Description

Dongsheng Logistics Software exposes an unauthenticated endpoint at /CommMng/Print/UploadMailFile that fails to enforce proper file type validation and access control. An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including executable scripts such as .ashx, via a crafted multipart/form-data POST request. This allows remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to July 2025 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-07-23 UTC.
