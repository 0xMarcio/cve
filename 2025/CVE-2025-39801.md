### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeoutsThis commit addresses a rarely observed endpoint command timeoutwhich causes kernel panic due to warn when 'panic_on_warn' is enabledand unnecessary call trace prints when 'panic_on_warn' is disabled.It is seen during fast software-controlled connect/disconnect testcases.The following is one such endpoint command timeout that we observed:1. Connect   =======->dwc3_thread_interrupt ->dwc3_ep0_interrupt  ->configfs_composite_setup   ->composite_setup    ->usb_ep_queue     ->dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue      ->__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue       ->__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data        ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd2. Disconnect   ==========->dwc3_thread_interrupt ->dwc3_gadget_disconnect_interrupt  ->dwc3_ep0_reset_state   ->dwc3_ep0_end_control_data    ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmdIn the issue scenario, in Exynos platforms, we observed that controltransfers for the previous connect have not yet been completed and endtransfer command sent as a part of the disconnect sequence andprocessing of USB_ENDPOINT_HALT feature request from the host timeout.This maybe an expected scenario since the controller is processing EPcommands sent as a part of the previous connect. It maybe better toremove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent toavoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn.
