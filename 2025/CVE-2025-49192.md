### Description

The web application is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. The site can be embedded into another frame, allowing an attacker to trick a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives. This could potentially reveal confidential information or allow others to take control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous objects.
