### Description

The Tripetto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.0.9. This is due to missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary results via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
