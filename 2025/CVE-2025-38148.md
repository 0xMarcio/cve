### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestampingFix memory leak when running one-step timestamping. When runningone-step sync timestamping, the HW is configured to insert the TX timeinto the frame, so there is no reason to keep the skb anymore. As inthis case the HW will never generate an interrupt to say that the framewas timestamped, then the frame will never released.Fix this by freeing the frame in case of one-step timestamping.
