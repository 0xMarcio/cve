### Description

The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the mwai_chatbot shortcode 'id' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
