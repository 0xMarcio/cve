### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:perf: Fix sample vs do_exit()Baisheng Gao reported an ARM64 crash, which Mark decoded as being asynchronous external abort -- most likely due to trying to accessMMIO in bad ways.The crash further shows perf trying to do a user stack sample while inexit_mmap()'s tlb_finish_mmu() -- i.e. while tearing down the addressspace it is trying to access.It turns out that we stop perf after we tear down the userspace mm; areceipie for disaster, since perf likes to access userspace forvarious reasons.Flip this order by moving up where we stop perf in do_exit().Additionally, harden PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN and PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USERto abort when the current task does not have an mm (exit_mm() makessure to set current->mm = NULL; before commencing with the actualteardown). Such that CPU wide events don't trip on this same problem.
