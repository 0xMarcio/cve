### Description

The Sparkle framework includes an XPC service Downloader.xpc, by default this service is private to the application its bundled with. A local unprivileged attacker can register this XPC service globally which will inherit TCC permissions of the application. Lack of validation of connecting client allows the attacker to copy TCC-protected files to an arbitrary location. Access to other resources beyond granted-permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.This issue was fixed in version 2.7.2
