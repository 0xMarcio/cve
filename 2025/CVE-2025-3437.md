### Description

The Motors â€“ Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in the ajax_actions.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.66. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute several initial set-up actions.
