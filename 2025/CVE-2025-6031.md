### Description

Amazon Cloud Cam is a home security camera that was deprecated on December 2, 2022, is end of life, and is no longer actively supported. When a user powers on the Amazon Cloud Cam, the device attempts to connect to a remote service infrastructure that has been deprecated due to end-of-life status. The device defaults to a pairing status in which an arbitrary user can bypass SSL pinning to associate the device to an arbitrary network, allowing for network traffic interception and modification.We recommend customers discontinue usage of any remaining Amazon Cloud Cams.
