### Description

MacOS version of Poedit bundles aÂ Python interpreter that inherits the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) permissionsgranted by the user to the main application bundle. An attacker with local user access caninvoke this interpreter with arbitrary commands or scripts, leveraging theapplication's previously granted TCC permissions to access user's files in privacy-protected folders without triggering user prompts. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Poedit, potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent.This issue has been fixed in 3.6.3 version of Poedit.
