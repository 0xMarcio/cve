### Description

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in white-labeled DVRs manufactured by TVT, affecting a custom HTTP service called "Cross Web Server" that listens on TCP ports 81 and 82. The web interface fails to sanitize input in the URI path passed to the language extraction functionality. When the server processes a request to /language/[lang]/index.html, it uses the [lang] input unsafely in a tar extraction command without proper escaping. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to inject shell commands and achieve arbitrary command execution as root.
