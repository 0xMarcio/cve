### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registeredRussell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULLpointer when unbinding this driver:https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULLtolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registeredsince the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():		if (cond && !cond(chip))			continue;These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chipdoes not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.
