If, for example, a trusted CA certificateshould be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but notfor CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is intendedto be marked as rejected with the -addreject option, the resulting CAcertificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.Only users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509command line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue.The issues affecting only the command line application are considered tobe Low severity.The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by thisissue.OpenSSL 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by thisissue.
