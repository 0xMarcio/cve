### Description

Atlantis is a self-hosted golang application that listens for Terraform pull request events via webhooks. All versions of Atlantis publicly expose detailed version information through its /status endpoint. This information disclosure could allow attackers to identify and target known vulnerabilities associated with the specific versions, potentially compromising the service's security posture. This issue does not currently have a fix.
