### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/hyperv: Fix address space leak when Hyper-V DRM device is removedWhen a Hyper-V DRM device is probed, the driver allocates MMIO space forthe vram, and maps it cacheable. If the device removed, or in the errorpath for device probing, the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.Consequently the kernel address space for the mapping is leaked.Fix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path, and in theerror path during device probing.
