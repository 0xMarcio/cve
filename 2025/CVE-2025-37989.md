### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: phy: leds: fix memory leakA network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition,which was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.The root cause is misuse of the devm API. The registration function(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct, notphy_probe, and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)is called from phy_detach, not phy_remove. This means the register andunregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHYdevice, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver isunbound.This also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak, as the devm APIinternally stores the allocated pointer.Fix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standardkzalloc/kcalloc, and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregisterpath.
