### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/ext: Fix invalid task state transitions on class switchWhen enabling a sched_ext scheduler, we may trigger invalid task statetransitions, resulting in warnings like the following (which can beeasily reproduced by running the hotplug selftest in a loop): sched_ext: Invalid task state transition 0 -> 3 for fish[770] WARNING: CPU: 18 PID: 787 at kernel/sched/ext.c:3862 scx_set_task_state+0x7c/0xc0 ... RIP: 0010:scx_set_task_state+0x7c/0xc0 ...
