### Description

The Realteo - Real Estate Plugin by Purethemes plugin for WordPress, used by the Findeo Theme, is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to insufficient role restrictions in the 'do_register_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account with the Administrator role.
