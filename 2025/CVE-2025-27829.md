### Description

An issue was discovered in Stormshield Network Security (SNS) 4.3.x before 4.3.35. If multicast streams are enabled on different interfaces, it may be possible to interrupt multicast traffic on some of these interfaces. That could result in a denial of the multicast routing service on the firewall.
