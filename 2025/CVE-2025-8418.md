### Description

The B Slider- Gutenberg Slider Block for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary Plugin Installation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.30. This is due to missing capability checks on the activated_plugin function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins on the server which can make remote code execution possible.
