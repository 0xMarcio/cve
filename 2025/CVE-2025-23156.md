### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: venus: hfi_parser: refactor hfi packet parsing logicwords_count denotes the number of words in total payload, while datapoints to payload of various property within it. When words_countreaches last word, data can access memory beyond the total payload. Thiscan lead to OOB access. With this patch, the utility api for handlingindividual properties now returns the size of data consumed. Accordinglyremaining bytes are calculated before parsing the payload, therebyeliminates the OOB access possibilities.
