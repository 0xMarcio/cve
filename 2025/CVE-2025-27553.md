### Description

Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.The FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method thattakes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that "an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent ofthe base file". However, when the path contains encoded ".."characters (for example, "%2E%2E/bar.txt"), it might return file objects that are nota descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.This issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.
