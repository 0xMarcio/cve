### Description

Fullscreen API Spoofing and UI Redressing in the handling of Fullscreen API and UI rendering in OpenAI Operator SaaS on Web allows a remote attacker to capture sensitive user input (e.g., login credentials, email addresses) via displaying a deceptive fullscreen interface with overlaid fake browser controls and a distracting element (like a cookie consent screen) to obscure fullscreen notifications, tricking the user into interacting with the malicious site.
