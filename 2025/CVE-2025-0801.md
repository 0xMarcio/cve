### Description

The RateMyAgent Official plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'rma-settings-wizard'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's API key via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
