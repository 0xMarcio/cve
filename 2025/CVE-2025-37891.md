### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: ump: Fix buffer overflow at UMP SysEx message conversionThe conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains aninternal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, asit was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data.However, the implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in adifferent format, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found indo_convert_to_ump().  It leads eventually to a buffer overflow, andmay corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received.The fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysExUMP message.
