### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu"There are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not agiven across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-upsand resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, wherelikely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodatefor this was only introduced after the initial software release (whichoften serves as a baseline for products).Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.
