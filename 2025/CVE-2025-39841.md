### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: lpfc: Fix buffer free/clear order in deferred receive pathFix a use-after-free window by correcting the buffer release sequence inthe deferred receive path. The code freed the RQ buffer first and onlythen cleared the context pointer under the lock. Concurrent paths (e.g.,ABTS and the repost path) also inspect and release the same pointer underthe lock, so the old order could lead to double-free/UAF.Note that the repost path already uses the correct pattern: detach thepointer under the lock, then free it after dropping the lock. Thedeferred path should do the same.
