### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix race condition on qfq_aggregateA race condition can occur when 'agg' is modified in qfq_change_agg(called during qfq_enqueue) while other threads access itconcurrently. For example, qfq_dump_class may trigger a NULLdereference, and qfq_delete_class may cause a use-after-free.This patch addresses the issue by:1. Moved qfq_destroy_class into the critical section.2. Added sch_tree_lock protection to qfq_dump_class andqfq_dump_class_stats.
