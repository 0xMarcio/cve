### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logicWriting to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle istriggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear thePTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.The issue can be reproduced with the following:$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -mNote: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way toquickly reproduce the issue.PHC2SYS exits with:"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out" when the PTM transaction  failsThis patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igcdriver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.The igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger inigc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.When a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.Due to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmasterstate and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When runningigc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NICregister hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.With this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periodswhen manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occursduring a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced.
