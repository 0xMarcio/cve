### Description

Kentico Xperience before 13.0.178 has a specific set of allowed ContentUploader file extensions for unauthenticated uploads; however, because .zip is processed through TryZipProviderSafe, there is additional functionality to create files with other extensions. NOTE: this is a separate issue not necessarily related to SVG or XSS.
