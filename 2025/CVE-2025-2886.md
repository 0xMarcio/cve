### Description

Missing validation of terminating delegation causes the client to continue searching the defined delegation list, even after searching a terminating delegation. This could cause the client to fetch a target from an incorrect source, altering the target contents. Users should upgrade to tough version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.
