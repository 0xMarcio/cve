### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: fix race between polling and detachingsyzbot reports a use-after-free in comedi in the below link, which isdue to comedi gladly removing the allocated async area even though pollrequests are still active on the wait_queue_head inside of it. This cancause a use-after-free when the poll entries are later triggered orremoved, as the memory for the wait_queue_head has been freed.  We needto check there are no tasks queued on any of the subdevices' wait queuesbefore allowing the device to be detached by the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG`ioctl.Tasks will read-lock `dev->attach_lock` before adding themselves to thesubdevice wait queue, so fix the problem in the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctlhandler by write-locking `dev->attach_lock` before checking that all ofthe subdevices are safe to be deleted.  This includes testing for anysleepers on the subdevices' wait queues.  It remains locked until thedevice has been detached.  This requires the `comedi_device_detach()`function to be refactored slightly, moving the bulk of it into newfunction `comedi_device_detach_locked()`.Note that the refactor of `comedi_device_detach()` results in`comedi_device_cancel_all()` now being called while `dev->attach_lock`is write-locked, which wasn't the case previously, but that does notmatter.Thanks to Jens Axboe for diagnosing the problem and co-developing thispatch.
