### Description

In the "bestinformed Web" application, some user input was not properly sanitized. This leads to multiple authenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.Â An authenticated attacker is able to compromise the sessions of other users on the server by injecting JavaScript code into their session using an "Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting". Those other users might have more privileges than the attacker, enabling a form of horizontal movement.
