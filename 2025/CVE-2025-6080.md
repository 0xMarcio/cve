### Description

The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized admin account creation in all versions up to, and including, 67.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's capabilities prior to adding users. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create new users, including admins.
