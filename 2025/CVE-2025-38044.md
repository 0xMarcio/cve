### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: cx231xx: set device_caps for 417The video_device for the MPEG encoder did not set device_caps.Add this, otherwise the video device can't be registered (you get aWARN_ON instead).Not seen before since currently 417 support is disabled, but I foundthis while experimenting with it.
