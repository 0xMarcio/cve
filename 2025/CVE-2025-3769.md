### Description

The LatePoint â€“ Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.92 via the 'view_booking_summary_in_lightbox' due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve appointment details such as customer names and email addresses.
