### Description

flaskBlog is a blog app built with Flask. In versions 2.8.1 and prior, improper sanitization of postContent when submitting POST requests to /createpost leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution (XSS) on all pages the post is reflected on including /, /post/[ID], /admin/posts, and /user/[ID] of the user that made the post. At time of publication, there are no public patches available.
