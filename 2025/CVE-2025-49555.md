### Description

Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.9-alpha1, 2.4.8-p1, 2.4.7-p6, 2.4.6-p11, 2.4.5-p13, 2.4.4-p14 and earlier are affected by a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could result in privilege escalation. A high-privileged attacker could trick a victim into executing unintended actions on a web application where the victim is authenticated, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must visit a malicious website or click on a crafted link. Scope is changed.
