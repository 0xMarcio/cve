### Description

The MongoDB Shell may be susceptible to control character injection where an attacker with control over the database cluster contents can inject control characters into the shell output. This may result in the display of falsified messages that appear to originate from mongosh or the underlying operating system, potentially misleading users into executing unsafe actions.The vulnerability is exploitable only when mongosh is connected to a cluster that is partially or fully controlled by an attacker.This issue affects mongosh versions prior to 2.3.9
