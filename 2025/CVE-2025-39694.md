### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/sclp: Fix SCCB present checkTracing code called by the SCLP interrupt handler contains early exitsif the SCCB address associated with an interrupt is NULL. This check isperformed after physical to virtual address translation.If the kernel identity mapping does not start at address zero, theresulting virtual address is never zero, so that the NULL checks won'twork. Subsequently this may result in incorrect accesses to the firstpage of the identity mapping.Fix this by introducing a function that handles the NULL case beforeaddress translation.
