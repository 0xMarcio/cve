### Description

The Car Dealer Automotive WordPress Theme â€“ Responsive theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_post_photo() and add_car() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The add_car() function may also make it possible to read arbitrary files.
