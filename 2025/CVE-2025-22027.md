### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: streamzap: fix race between device disconnection and urb callbackSyzkaller has reported a general protection fault at functionir_raw_event_store_with_filter(). This crash is caused by a NULL pointerdereference of dev->raw pointer, even though it is checked for NULL inthe same function, which means there is a race condition. It occurs dueto the incorrect order of actions in the streamzap_disconnect() function:rc_unregister_device() is called before usb_kill_urb(). The dev->rawpointer is freed and set to NULL in rc_unregister_device(), and onlyafter that usb_kill_urb() waits for in-progress requests to finish.If rc_unregister_device() is called while streamzap_callback() handler isnot finished, this can lead to accessing freed resources. Thusrc_unregister_device() should be called after usb_kill_urb().Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.
