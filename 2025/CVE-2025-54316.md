### Description

An issue was discovered in Logpoint before 7.6.0. When creating reports, attackers can create custom Jinja templates that chained built-in filter functions to generate XSS payloads. These payloads can be rendered by the Logpoint Report Template engine, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
