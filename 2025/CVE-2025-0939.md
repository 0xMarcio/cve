### Description

The MagicForm plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the plugin's AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to invoke those actions in order to delete or view logs, modify forms or modify plugin settings.
