### Description

The protocol used for remote linking over RF for End-of-Train and Head-of-Train (also known as a FRED) relies on a BCH checksum for packet creation. It is possible to create these EoT and HoT packets with a software defined radio and issue brake control commands to the EoT device, disrupting operations or potentially overwhelming the brake systems.
