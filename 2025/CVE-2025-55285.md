### Description

@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage software templates. Prior to version 2.1.1, duplicate logging of the input values in the fetch:template action in the Scaffolder meant that some of the secrets were not properly redacted. If ${{ secrets.x }} is not passed through to fetch:template there is no impact. This issue has been resolved in 2.1.1 of the scaffolder-backend plugin. A workaround for this issue involves Template Authors removing the use of ${{ secrets }} being used as an argument to fetch:template.
