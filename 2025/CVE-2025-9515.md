### Description

The Multi Step Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the import functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.25. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
