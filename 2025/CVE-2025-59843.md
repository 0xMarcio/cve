### Description

Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. From versions 2.0.0 to before 2.3.1, the public endpoint /api/user/[username] returns user email addresses in its JSON response. The problem has been patched in FlagForge version 2.3.1. The fix removes email addresses from public API responses while keeping the endpoint publicly accessible. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.1 or later to eliminate exposure. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
