### Description

Missing validation of the root metatdata version number could allow an actor to supply an arbitrary version number to the client instead of the intended version in the root metadata file, altering the version fetched by the client. Users should upgrade to tough version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.
