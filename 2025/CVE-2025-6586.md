### Description

The Download Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the dpwap_plugin_locInstall function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
