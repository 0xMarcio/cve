### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Ensure we don't read past the ELF headerWhen the MDT loader is used in remoteproc, the ELF header is sanitizedbeforehand, but that's not necessary the case for other clients.Validate the size of the firmware buffer to ensure that we don't readpast the end as we iterate over the header. e_phentsize and e_shentsizeare validated as well, to ensure that the assumptions about step size inthe traversal are valid.
