### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlockWhen some client process A call pdr_add_lookup() to add the look up forthe service and does schedule locator work, later a process B got a newserver packet indicating locator is up and call pdr_locator_new_server()which eventually sets pdr->locator_init_complete to true which process Asees and takes list lock and queries domain list but it will timeout dueto deadlock as the response will queued to the same qmi->wq and it isordered workqueue and process B is not able to complete new serverrequest work due to deadlock on list lock.Fix it by removing the unnecessary list iteration as the list iterationis already being done inside locator work, so avoid it here and justcall schedule_work() here.       Process A                        Process B                                     process_scheduled_works()pdr_add_lookup()                      qmi_data_ready_work() process_scheduled_works()             pdr_locator_new_server()                                         pdr->locator_init_complete=true;   pdr_locator_work()    mutex_lock(&pdr->list_lock);     pdr_locate_service()                  mutex_lock(&pdr->list_lock);      pdr_get_domain_list()       pr_err("PDR: %s get domain list               txn wait failed: %d\n",               req->service_name,               ret);Timeout error log due to deadlock:" PDR: tms/servreg get domain list txn wait failed: -110 PDR: service lookup for msm/adsp/sensor_pd:tms/servreg failed: -110"Thanks to Bjorn and Johan for letting me know that this commit also fixesan audio regression when using the in-kernel pd-mapper as that makes iteasier to hit this race.
