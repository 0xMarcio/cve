### Description

An open redirect vulnerability in Reolink v4.54.0.4.20250526 allows attackers to redirect users to a malicious site via a crafted URL. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because it is intentional behavior that supports redirection to Alexa URLs, which are not guaranteed to remain at the same domain indefinitely.
