### Description

An issue was discovered on Marbella KR8s Dashcam FF 2.0.8 devices. All dashcams were shipped with the same default credentials of 12345678, which creates an insecure-by-default condition. For users who change their passwords, it's limited to 8 characters. These short passwords can be cracked in 8 hours via low-end commercial cloud resources.
