### Description

WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. Versions prior to 3.2.8 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows unauthorized scripts to be executed within the user's browser context. Stored XSS is particularly critical, as the malicious code is permanently stored on the server and executed whenever a compromised page is loaded, affecting all users accessing this page. Version 3.2.8 fixes the issue.
