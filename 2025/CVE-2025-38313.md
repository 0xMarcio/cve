### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bus: fsl-mc: fix double-free on mc_devThe blamed commit tried to simplify how the deallocations are done but,in the process, introduced a double-free on the mc_dev variable.In case the MC device is a DPRC, a new mc_bus is allocated and themc_dev variable is just a reference to one of its fields. In thiscircumstance, on the error path only the mc_bus should be freed.This commit introduces back the following checkpatch warning which is afalse-positive.WARNING: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required+       if (mc_bus)+               kfree(mc_bus);
