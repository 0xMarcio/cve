### Description

The Slider, Gallery, and Carousel by MetaSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘aria-label’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.98.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
