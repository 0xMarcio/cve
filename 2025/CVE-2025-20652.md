### Description

In V5 DA, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure, if an attacker has physical access to the device, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS09291215; Issue ID: MSV-2052.
