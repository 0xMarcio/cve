### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storageLonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storagecan be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing acgroup local storage with a different value size, and one programdoing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each ofthe indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime contextthe bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains theBPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the programuses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from theruntime context:  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);  storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];  if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)    ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];  else    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);For the second program which was called from the originally attachedone, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the formerprogram's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can resultin an unintended out-of-bounds access.To fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array ofstorage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the originalprogram if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), orii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was notusing any of the cgroup local storage maps.
