### Description

Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package starting in version 9.22.0 and prior to version 12.0.1, corresponding to Directus starting in version 9.22.0 and prior to 11.5.0, is vulnerable to asset unavailability after a burst of malformed transformations. When making many malformed transformation requests at once, at some point, all assets are served as 403. This causes denial of assets for all policies of Directus, including Admin and Public. Version 12.0.1 of the `@directus/storage-driver-s3` package, corresponding to version 11.5.0 of Directus, fixes the issue.
