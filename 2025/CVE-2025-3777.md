### Description

Hugging Face Transformers versions up to 4.49.0 are affected by an improper input validation vulnerability in the `image_utils.py` file. The vulnerability arises from insecure URL validation using the `startswith()` method, which can be bypassed through URL username injection. This allows attackers to craft URLs that appear to be from YouTube but resolve to malicious domains, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or data exfiltration. The issue is fixed in version 4.52.1.
