### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sctp: sysctl: udp_port: avoid using current->nsproxyAs mentioned in a previous commit of this series, using the 'net'structure via 'current' is not recommended for different reasons:- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only  from the opener's netns.- current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by  syzbot [1] using acct(2).The 'net' structure can be obtained from the table->data usingcontainer_of().Note that table->data could also be used directly, but that wouldincrease the size of this fix, while 'sctp.ctl_sock' still needs to beretrieved from 'net' structure.
