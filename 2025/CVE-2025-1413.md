### Description

DaVinci Resolve on MacOS was found to be installed with incorrect file permissions (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard macOS security practices, where applications should have drwxr-xr-x permissions. Incorrect permissions allow for Dylib Hijacking. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. This issue affects DaVinci Resolve on MacOS in versionsÂ before 19.1.3.
