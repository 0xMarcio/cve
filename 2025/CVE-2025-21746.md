### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:Input: synaptics - fix crash when enabling pass-through portWhen enabling a pass-through port an interrupt might come before psmousedriver binds to the pass-through port. However synaptics sub-drivertries to access psmouse instance presumably associated with thepass-through port to figure out if only 1 byte of response or entireprotocol packet needs to be forwarded to the pass-through port and maycrash if psmouse instance has not been attached to the port yet.Fix the crash by introducing open() and close() methods for the port andcheck if the port is open before trying to access psmouse instance.Because psmouse calls serio_open() only after attaching psmouse instanceto serio port instance this prevents the potential crash.
