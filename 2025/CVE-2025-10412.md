### Description

The Product Options and Price Calculation Formulas for WooCommerce â€“ Uni CPO (Premium) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to misconfigured file type validation in the 'uni_cpo_upload_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.54. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
