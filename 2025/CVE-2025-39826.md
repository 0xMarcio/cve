### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_tThe 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter butlacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neighstructure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.For example, when rose_neigh->use becomes zero during an ioctl operationvia rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer isstill active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.This patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t andupdates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() whichoperate reference counts atomically.
