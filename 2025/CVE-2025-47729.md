### Description

The TeleMessage archiving backend through 2025-05-05 holds cleartext copies of messages from TM SGNL (aka Archive Signal) app users, which is different functionality than described in the TeleMessage "End-to-End encryption from the mobile phone through to the corporate archive" documentation, as exploited in the wild in May 2025.
