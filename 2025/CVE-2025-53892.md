### Description

Vue I18n is the internationalization plugin for Vue.js. The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0, this setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as <img src=x onerror=...>, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using v-html. This may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using escapeParameterHtml: true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html. Versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0 contain a fix for the issue.
