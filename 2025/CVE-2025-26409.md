### Description

A serial interface can be accessed with physical access to the PCB of Wattsense Bridge devices. After connecting to the interface, access to the bootloader is possible, as well as a Linux login prompt. The bootloader access can be used to gain a root shell on the device. This issue is fixed inÂ recent firmware versions BSP >= 6.4.1.
