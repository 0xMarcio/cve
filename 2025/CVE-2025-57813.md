### Description

traQ is a messenger application built for Digital Creators Club traP. Prior to version 3.25.0, a vulnerability exists where sensitive information, such as OAuth tokens, are recorded in log files when an error occurs during the execution of an SQL query. An attacker could intentionally trigger an SQL error by methods such as placing a high load on the database. This could allow an attacker who has the authority to view the log files to illicitly acquire the recorded sensitive information. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.25.0. If upgrading is not possible, a temporary workaround involves reviewing access permissions for SQL error logs and strictly limiting access to prevent unauthorized users from viewing them.
