### Description

In the "bestinformed Web" application, some user input was not properly sanitized. This leads to multiple unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.Â An unauthenticated attacker is able to compromise the sessions of users on the server by injecting JavaScript code into their session using an "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting". The attacker is then able to ride the session of those users and can abuse their privileges on the "bestinformed Web" application.
