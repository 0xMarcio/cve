### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: avoid journaling sb update on error if journal is destroyingPresently we always BUG_ON if trying to start a transaction on a journal markedwith JBD2_UNMOUNT, since this should never happen. However, while ltp runningstress tests, it was observed that in case of some error handling paths, it ispossible for update_super_work to start a transaction after the journal isdestroyed eg:(umount)ext4_kill_sb  kill_block_super    generic_shutdown_super      sync_filesystem /* commits all txns */      evict_inodes        /* might start a new txn */      ext4_put_super	flush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work) /* flush the workqueue */        jbd2_journal_destroy          journal_kill_thread            journal->j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;          jbd2_journal_commit_transaction            jbd2_journal_get_descriptor_buffer              jbd2_journal_bmap                ext4_journal_bmap                  ext4_map_blocks                    ...                    ext4_inode_error                      ext4_handle_error                        schedule_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)                                               /* work queue kicks in */                                               update_super_work                                                 jbd2_journal_start                                                   start_this_handle                                                     BUG_ON(journal->j_flags &                                                            JBD2_UNMOUNT)Hence, introduce a new mount flag to indicate journal is destroying and only doa journaled (and deferred) update of sb if this flag is not set. Otherwise, justfallback to an un-journaled commit.Further, in the journal destroy path, we have the following sequence:  1. Set mount flag indicating journal is destroying  2. force a commit and wait for it  3. flush pending sb updatesThis sequence is important as it ensures that, after this point, there is no sbupdate that might be journaled so it is safe to update the sb outside thejournal. (To avoid race discussed in 2d01ddc86606)Also, we don't need a similar check in ext4_grp_locked_error since it is onlycalled from mballoc and AFAICT it would be always valid to schedule work here.
