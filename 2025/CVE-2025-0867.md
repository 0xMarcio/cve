### Description

The standard user uses the run as function to start the MEAC applications with administrative privileges. To ensure that the system can startup on its own, the credentials of the administrator were stored. Consequently, the EPC2 user can execute any command with administrative privileges. This allows a privilege escalation to the administrative level.
