### Description

By crafting a malformed file name for an attachment in a multipart message, an attacker can trick Thunderbird into including a directory listing of /tmp when the message is forwarded or edited as a new message. This vulnerability could allow attackers to disclose sensitive information from the victim's system. This vulnerability is not limited to Linux; similar behavior has been observed on Windows as well. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 137.0.2 and Thunderbird < 128.9.2.
