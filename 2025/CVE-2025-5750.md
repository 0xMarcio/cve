### Description

WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger tuya_svc_devos_activate_result_parse Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the handling of the secKey, localKey, stdTimeZone and devId parameters. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26294.
