### Description

It was discovered that uscan, a tool to scan/watch upstream sources for new releases of software, included in devscripts (a collection of scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier), skips OpenPGP verification if the upstream source is already downloaded from a previous run even if the verification failed back then.
