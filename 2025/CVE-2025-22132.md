### Description

WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the file upload functionality of the WeGIA/html/socio/sistema/controller/controla_xlsx.php endpoint. By uploading a file containing malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to information theft, session hijacking, and other forms of client-side exploitation. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.7.
