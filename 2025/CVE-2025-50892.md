### Description

The eudskacs.sys driver version 20250328 shipped with EaseUs Todo Backup 1.2.0.1 fails to properly validate privileges for I/O requests (IRP_MJ_READ/IRP_MJ_WRITE) sent to its device object. This allows a local, low-privileged attacker to perform arbitrary raw disk reads and writes, leading to sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, or local privilege escalation.
