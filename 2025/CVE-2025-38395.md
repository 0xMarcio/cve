### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:regulator: gpio: Fix the out-of-bounds access to drvdata::gpiodsdrvdata::gpiods is supposed to hold an array of 'gpio_desc' pointers. Butthe memory is allocated for only one pointer. This will lead toout-of-bounds access later in the code if 'config::ngpios' is > 1. Sofix the code to allocate enough memory to hold 'config::ngpios' of GPIOdescriptors.While at it, also move the check for memory allocation failure to be belowthe allocation to make it more readable.
