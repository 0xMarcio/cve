### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: cadence: macb: Fix a possible deadlock in macb_halt_tx.There is a situation where after THALT is set high, TGO stays high aswell. Because jiffies are never updated, as we are in a context withinterrupts disabled, we never exit that loop and have a deadlock.That deadlock was noticed on a sama5d4 device that stayed locked for days.Use retries instead of jiffies so that the timeout really works and we donot have a deadlock anymore.
