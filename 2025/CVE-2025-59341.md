### Description

esm.sh is a nobuild content delivery network(CDN) for modern web development. In 136 and earlier, a Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue was identified in the esm.sh service URL handling. An attacker could craft a request that causes the server to read and return files from the host filesystem (or other unintended file sources).
