### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:atm: clip: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in to_atmarpd().atmarpd is protected by RTNL since commit f3a0592b37b8 ("[ATM]: clipcauses unregister hang").However, it is not enough because to_atmarpd() is called without RTNL,especially clip_neigh_solicit() / neigh_ops->solicit() is unsleepable.Also, there is no RTNL dependency around atmarpd.Let's use a private mutex and RCU to protect access to atmarpd into_atmarpd().
