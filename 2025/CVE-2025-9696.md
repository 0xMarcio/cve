### Description

The SunPower PVS6's BluetoothLE interface is vulnerable due to its use of hardcoded encryption parameters and publicly accessible protocol details. An attacker within Bluetooth range could exploit this vulnerability to gain full access to the device's servicing interface. This access allows the attacker to perform actions such as firmware replacement, disabling power production, modifying grid settings, creating SSH tunnels, altering firewall settings, and manipulating connected devices.
