### Description

NeKernal is a free and open-source operating system stack. Prior to version 0.0.3, there are several memory safety issues that can lead to memory corruption, disk image corruption, denial of service, and potential code execution. These issues stem from unchecked memory operations, unsafe typecasting, and improper input validation. This issue has been patched in version 0.0.3.
