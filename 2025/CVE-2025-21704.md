### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before accessIf the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can'tcalculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notificationinstead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which canlead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases betweenfragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.This issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,it only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1("cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications").A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspacehas opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager willdo that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs andits other interfaces.
