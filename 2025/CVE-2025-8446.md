### Description

The Blaze Demo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized limited plugin install due to a missing capability check on the 'blaze_demo_importer_install_plugin' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install and activate a limited number of specific plugins. The News Kit Elementor Addons plugin and a BlazeThemes theme must be installed and activated in order to exploit the vulnerability.
