### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistenciesio_bitmap_exit() is invoked from exit_thread() when a task exists orwhen a fork fails. In the latter case the exit_thread() cleans upresources which were allocated during fork().io_bitmap_exit() invokes task_update_io_bitmap(), which in turn ends upin tss_update_io_bitmap(). tss_update_io_bitmap() operates on thecurrent task. If current has TIF_IO_BITMAP set, but no bitmap installed,tss_update_io_bitmap() crashes with a NULL pointer dereference.There are two issues, which lead to that problem:  1) io_bitmap_exit() should not invoke task_update_io_bitmap() when     the task, which is cleaned up, is not the current task. That's a     clear indicator for a cleanup after a failed fork().  2) A task should not have TIF_IO_BITMAP set and neither a bitmap     installed nor IOPL emulation level 3 activated.     This happens when a kernel thread is created in the context of     a user space thread, which has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as the thread     flags are copied and the IO bitmap pointer is cleared.     Other than in the failed fork() case this has no impact because     kernel threads including IO workers never return to user space and     therefore never invoke tss_update_io_bitmap().Cure this by adding the missing cleanups and checks:  1) Prevent io_bitmap_exit() to invoke task_update_io_bitmap() if     the to be cleaned up task is not the current task.  2) Clear TIF_IO_BITMAP in copy_thread() unconditionally. For user     space forks it is set later, when the IO bitmap is inherited in     io_bitmap_share().For paranoia sake, add a warning into tss_update_io_bitmap() to catchthe case, when that code is invoked with inconsistent state.
