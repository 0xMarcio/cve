### Description

samlify is a Node.js library for SAML single sign-on. A Signature Wrapping attack has been found in samlify prior to version 2.10.0, allowing an attacker to forge a SAML Response to authenticate as any user. An attacker would need a signed XML document by the identity provider. Version 2.10.0 fixes the issue.
