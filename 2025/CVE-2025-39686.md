### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn->n samplesThe `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as a default handler for`INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for`INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a defaulthandler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handlerfor `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`instructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,indicated by the `insn->n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currentlyonly handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core willcopy `insn->n` samples back to user-space.  (That triggered KASANkernel-infoleak errors when `insn->n` was greater than 1, but that isbeing fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)Make `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either handle `insn->n` samples, or returnan error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ` and`INSN_WRITE` handlers.
