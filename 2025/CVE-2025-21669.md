### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changesIf the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,we must discard any packets received because they are not expectedand would cause issues when we access vsk->transport.A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,where after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a secondconnect() failed, we can find `vsk->transport` at NULL, leading to aNULL pointer dereference.
