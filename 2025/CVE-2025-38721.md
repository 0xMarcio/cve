### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dumpThere is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():      if (res < 0) {                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general); // HERE                cb->args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;                ...While its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last.If this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented.This 2nd increment is never undone.This prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turnkeeps prevents cnet->count from dropping back to 0.This will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) asnf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop.It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average beforeI see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.One fix would to change this to:        if (res < 0) {		if (ct != last)	                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general);But this reference counting isn't needed in the first place.We can just store a cookie value instead.A followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table,it looks to me as if this has the same problem and likectnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actualobject so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as well.
