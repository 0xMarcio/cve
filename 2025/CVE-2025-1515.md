### Description

The WP Real Estate Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.8. This is due to insufficient identity verification on the LinkedIn login request process. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass official authentication and log in as any user on the site, including administrators.
