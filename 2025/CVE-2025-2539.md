### Description

The File Away plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.9.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, leveraging the use of a reversible weak algorithm,  to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
