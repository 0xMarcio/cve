### Description

Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In somecases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executablestub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to behandled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logicto set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, themetadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen fromhandling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.
