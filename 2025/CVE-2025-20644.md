### Description

In Modem, there is a possible memory corruption due to incorrect error handling. This could lead to remote denial of service, if a UE has connected to a rogue base station controlled by the attacker, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: MOLY01525673; Issue ID: MSV-2747.
