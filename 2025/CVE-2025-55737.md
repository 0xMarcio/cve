### Description

flaskBlog is a blog app built with Flask. In 2.8.0 and earlier, when deleting a comment, there's no validation of the ownership of the comment. Every user can delete an arbitrary comment of another user on every post, by simply intercepting the delete request and changing the commentID. The code that causes the problem is in routes/post.py.
