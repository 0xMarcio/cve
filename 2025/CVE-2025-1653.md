### Description

The Directory Listings WordPress plugin â€“ uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.7. This is due to the stm_listing_profile_edit AJAX action not having enough restriction on the user meta that can be updated. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.
