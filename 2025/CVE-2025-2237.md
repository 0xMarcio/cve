### Description

The WP RealEstate plugin for WordPress, used by the Homeo theme, is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.26. This is due to insufficient role restrictions in the 'process_register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account with the Administrator role.
