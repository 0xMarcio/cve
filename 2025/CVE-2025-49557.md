### Description

Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.9-alpha1, 2.4.8-p1, 2.4.7-p6, 2.4.6-p11, 2.4.5-p13, 2.4.4-p14 and earlier are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must browse to the page containing the vulnerable field. Scope is changed.
