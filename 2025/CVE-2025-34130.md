### Description

An unauthenticated arbitrary file read exists in LILIN Digital Video Recorder (DVR) devices prior to firmware version 2.0b60_20200207 via the /z/zbin/net_html.cgi endpoint. This vulnerability allows attackers to read sensitive configuration files, such as /zconf/service.xml, which can then be used to facilitate further attacks including command injection. The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild in conjunction with other issues by botnets like FBot and Moobot.
