### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: handle get_client_locked() failure in nfsd4_setclientid_confirm()Lei Lu recently reported that nfsd4_setclientid_confirm() did not checkthe return value from get_client_locked(). a SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM couldrace with a confirmed client expiring and fail to get a reference. Thatcould later lead to a UAF.Fix this by getting a reference early in the case where there is anextant confirmed client. If that fails then treat it as if there were noconfirmed client found at all.In the case where the unconfirmed client is expiring, just fail andreturn the result from get_client_locked().
