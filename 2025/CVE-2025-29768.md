### Description

Vim, a text editor, is vulnerable to potential data loss with zip.vim and special crafted zip files in versions prior to 9.1.1198. The impact is medium because a user must be made to view such an archive with Vim and then press 'x' on such a strange filename. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1198.
