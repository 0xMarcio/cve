### Description

An incorrect permission assignment vulnerability in the PostgreSQL commands of the Zyxel USG FLEX H series uOS firmware versions from V1.20 through V1.31 could allow an authenticated local attacker with low privileges to gain access to the Linux shell and escalate their privileges by crafting malicious scripts or modifying system configurations with administrator-level access through a stolen token. Modifying the system configuration is only possible if the administrator has not logged out and the token remains valid.
