### Description

Frappe is a full-stack web application framework. Prior to versions 14.89.0 and 15.51.0, making crafted requests could lead to information disclosure that could further lead to account takeover. Versions 14.89.0 and 15.51.0 fix the issue. There's no workaround to fix this without upgrading.
