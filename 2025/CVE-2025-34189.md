### Description

Vasion Print (formerly PrinterLogic) Virtual Appliance Host versions prior to 1.0.735 and Application versions prior to 20.0.1330 (macOS/Linux client deployments) contain a vulnerability in the local inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. The software stores IPC request and response files inside /opt/PrinterInstallerClient/tmp with world-readable and world-writable permissions. Any local user can craft malicious request files that are processed by privileged daemons, leading to unauthorized actions being executed in other user sessions. This breaks user session isolation, potentially allowing local attackers to hijack sessions, perform unintended actions in the context of other users, and impact system integrity and availability.
