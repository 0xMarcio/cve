### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/rxe: Flush delayed SKBs while releasing RXE resourcesWhen skb packets are sent out, these skb packets still depends onthe rxe resources, for example, QP, sk, when these packets aredestroyed.If these rxe resources are released when the skb packets are destroyed,the call traces will appear.To avoid skb packets hang too long time in some network devices,a timestamp is added when these skb packets are created. If theseskb packets hang too long time in network devices, these networkdevices can free these skb packets to release rxe resources.
