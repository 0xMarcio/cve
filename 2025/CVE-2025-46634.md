### Description

Cleartext transmission of sensitive information in the web management portal of the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 may allow an unauthenticated attacker to authenticate to the web management portal by collecting credentials from observed/collected traffic. It implements encryption, but not until after the user has transmitted the hash of their password in cleartext. The hash can be replayed to authenticate.
