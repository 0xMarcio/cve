### Description

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in AVTECH IP camera, DVR, and NVR devices via the PwdGrp.cgi endpoint, which handles user and group management operations. Authenticated users can supply input through the pwd or grp parameters, which are directly embedded into system commands without proper sanitation. This allows for the execution of arbitrary shell commands with root privileges.
