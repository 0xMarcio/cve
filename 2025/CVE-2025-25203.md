### Description

CtrlPanel is open-source billing software for hosting providers. Prior to version 1.0, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `TicketsController` and `Moderation/TicketsController` due to insufficient input validation on the `priority` field during ticket creation and unsafe rendering of this field in the moderator panel. Version 1.0 contains a patch for the issue.
