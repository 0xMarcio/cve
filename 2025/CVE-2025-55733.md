### Description

DeepChat is a smart assistant that connects powerful AI to your personal world.  DeepChat before 0.3.1 has a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted deepchat: URL on any website, including a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers the app’s custom URL handler (deepchat:), causing the DeepChat application to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.1.
