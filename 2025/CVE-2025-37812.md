### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: cdns3: Fix deadlock when using NCM gadgetThe cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit58f2fcb3a845 ("usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget").Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy networktraffic, for example using "iperf --bidir" over NCM ethernet link.The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler getspreempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock.Prevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.
