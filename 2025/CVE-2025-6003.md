### Description

The WordPress Single Sign-On (SSO) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a misconfigured capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including, the *.5.3 versions of the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including site content that has been restricted to certain users and/or roles.
