### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:vlan: enforce underlying device typeCurrently, VLAN devices can be created on top of non-ethernet devices.Besides the fact that it doesn't make much sense, this also causes abug which leaks the address of a kernel function to usermode.When creating a VLAN device, we initialize GARP (garp_init_applicant)and MRP (mrp_init_applicant) for the underlying device.As part of the initialization process, we add the multicast address ofeach applicant to the underlying device, by calling dev_mc_add.__dev_mc_add uses dev->addr_len to determine the length of the newmulticast address.This causes an out-of-bounds read if dev->addr_len is greater than 6,since the multicast addresses provided by GARP and MRP are only 6bytes long.This behaviour can be reproduced using the following commands:ip tunnel add gretest mode ip6gre local ::1 remote ::2 dev loip l set up dev gretestip link add link gretest name vlantest type vlan id 100Then, the following command will display the address of garp_pdu_rcv:ip maddr show | grep 01:80:c2:00:00:21Fix the bug by enforcing the type of the underlying device during VLANdevice initialization.
