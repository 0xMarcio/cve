### Description

An internal product security audit of Lenovo XClarity Orchestrator (LXCO) discovered the below vulnerability:An attacker with access to a device on the local Lenovo XClarity Orchestrator (LXCO) network segment may be able to manipulate the local device to create an alternate communication channel which could allow the attacker, under certain conditions, to directly interact with backend LXCO API services typically inaccessible to users. While access controls may limit the scope of interaction, this could result in unauthorized access to internal functionality or data. This issue is not exploitable from remote networks.
