### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:netdev: prevent accessing NAPI instances from another namespaceThe NAPI IDs were not fully exposed to user space prior to the netlinkAPI, so they were never namespaced. The netlink API must ensure thatat the very least NAPI instance belongs to the same netns as the ownerof the genl sock.napi_by_id() can become static now, but it needs to move because ofdev_get_by_napi_id().
