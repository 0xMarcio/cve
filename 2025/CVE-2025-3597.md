### Description

The Firelight Lightbox WordPress plugin before 2.3.15 does not prevent users with post writing capabilities from executing arbitrary Javascript when the jQuery Metadata library is enabled. While this feature is meant to only be available to Pro version users, it can be activated in the free version too, making it theoretically exploitable there as well.
