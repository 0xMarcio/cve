### Description

In Proget MDM, a low-privileged user can retrieve passwords for managed devices and subsequently use functionalities restricted by the MDM (Mobile Device Management). For it to happen, they must know the UUIDs of targetted devices, which might be obtained by exploiting CVE-2025-1415 or CVE-2025-1417.This issue has been fixed in 2.17.5 version of Konsola Proget (server part of the MDM suite).
