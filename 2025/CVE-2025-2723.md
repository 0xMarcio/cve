### Description

** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: The code maintainer explains that "[the] call is invalid [as] the buffer pointed to by "data" must have "len" valid bytes." The documentation was fixed to make that clear.
