### Description

The Master Addons â€“ Elementor Addons with White Label, Free Widgets, Hover Effects, Conditions, & Animations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several widgets in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.8.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
