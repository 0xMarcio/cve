### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:spufs: fix gang directory lifetimesprior to "[POWERPC] spufs: Fix gang destroy leaks" we used to havea problem with gang lifetimes - creation of a gang returns openedgang directory, which normally gets removed when that gets closed,but if somebody has created a context belonging to that gang andkept it alive until the gang got closed, removal failed and weended up with a leak.Unfortunately, it had been fixed the wrong way.  Dentry of gangdirectory was no longer pinned, and rmdir on close was gone.One problem was that failure of open kept calling simple_rmdir()as cleanup, which meant an unbalanced dput().  Another bug wasin the success case - gang creation incremented link count onroot directory, but that was no longer undone when gang gotdestroyed.Fix consists of	* reverting the commit in question	* adding a counter to gang, protected by ->i_rwsemof gang directory inode.	* having it set to 1 at creation time, droppedin both spufs_dir_close() and spufs_gang_close() and bumpedin spufs_create_context(), provided that it's not 0.	* using simple_recursive_removal() to take the gangdirectory out when counter reaches zero.
