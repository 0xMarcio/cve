### Description

The 2wcom IP-4c 2.15.5 device suffers from a Broken Access Control vulnerability. Certain sensitive endpoints are intended to be accessible only after the admin explicitly grants access to a manager-level account. However, a manager-level user can bypass these controls by intercepting and modifying requests.
