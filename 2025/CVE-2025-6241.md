### Description

LsiAgent.exe, a component of SysTrack from Lakeside Software, attempts to load several DLL files which are not present in the default installation. If a user-writable directory is present in the SYSTEM PATH environment variable, the user can write a malicious DLL to that directory with arbitrary code. This malicious DLL is executed in the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM upon service start or restart, due to the Windows default dynamic-link library search order, resulting in local elevation of privileges.
