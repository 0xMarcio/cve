### Description

The hard drives of the device are not encrypted using a full volume encryption feature such as BitLocker. This allows an attacker with physical access to the device to use an alternative operating system to interact with the hard drives, completely circumventing the Windows login. The attacker can read from and write to all files on the hard drives.
