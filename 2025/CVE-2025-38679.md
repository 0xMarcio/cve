### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: venus: Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound checkCurrently, The event_seq_changed() handler processes a variable numberof properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is indicatedby the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, thepayload size is not being validated against the actual message length.This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the firmware provides aproperty count that exceeds the data available in the payload. Such acondition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks ifmemory beyond the buffer is accessed.Fix this by properly validating the remaining size of the payload beforeeach property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties areparsed.This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the receivedmessage buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmwarebehavior.
