### Description

The Advanced Views â€“ Display Posts, Custom Fields, and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.19. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of access control when processing custom Twig templates in the Model panel. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access or higher, to execute arbitrary PHP code and commands on the server.
