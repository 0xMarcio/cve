### Description

BigAntSoft BigAnt Server, up to and including version 5.6.06, is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution via account registration. An unauthenticated remote attacker can create an administrative user through the default exposed SaaS registration mechanism. Once an administrator, the attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code using the "Cloud Storage Addin," leading to unauthenticated code execution.
