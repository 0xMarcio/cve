### Description

The Kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary folder deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_font() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.21.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary folders on the server.
