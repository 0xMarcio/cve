### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ppp: fix race conditions in ppp_fill_forward_pathppp_fill_forward_path() has two race conditions:1. The ppp->channels list can change between list_empty() and   list_first_entry(), as ppp_lock() is not held. If the only channel   is deleted in ppp_disconnect_channel(), list_first_entry() may   access an empty head or a freed entry, and trigger a panic.2. pch->chan can be NULL. When ppp_unregister_channel() is called,   pch->chan is set to NULL before pch is removed from ppp->channels.Fix these by using a lockless RCU approach:- Use list_first_or_null_rcu() to safely test and access the first list  entry.- Convert list modifications on ppp->channels to their RCU variants and  add synchronize_net() after removal.- Check for a NULL pch->chan before dereferencing it.
