### Description

A potential insufficient access control vulnerability was reported in the Lenovo Dispatcher 3.0 and Dispatcher 3.1 drivers used by some Lenovo consumer notebooks that could allow an authenticated local user to execute code with elevated privileges. The Lenovo Dispatcher 3.2 driver is not affected. This vulnerability does not affect systems when the Windows feature Core Isolation Memory Integrity is enabled. Lenovo systems preloaded with Windows 11 have this feature enabled by default.
