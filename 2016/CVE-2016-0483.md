### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u105, 7u91, and 8u66; Java SE Embedded 8u65; and JRockit R28.3.8 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to AWT.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this is a heap-based buffer overflow in the readImage function, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted image data.
