### Description

Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying edit check permissions on WebDAV copy actions. The WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to modify existing files.
