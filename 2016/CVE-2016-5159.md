### Description

Multiple integer overflows in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data that is mishandled during opj_aligned_malloc calls in dwt.c and t1.c.
