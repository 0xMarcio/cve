### Description

It was discovered that EAP packages in certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux use incorrect permissions for /etc/sysconfig/jbossas configuration files. The file is writable to jboss group (root:jboss, 664). On systems using classic /etc/init.d init scripts (i.e. on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier), the file is sourced by the jboss init script and its content executed with root privileges when jboss service is started, stopped, or restarted.
