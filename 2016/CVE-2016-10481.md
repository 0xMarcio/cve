### Description

In Android before 2018-04-05 or earlier security patch level on Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile and Snapdragon Wear MDM9206, MDM9607, MDM9635M, MDM9640, MDM9650, QCA4531, QCA6174A, QCA6574AU, QCA6584, QCA6584AU, QCA9377, QCA9378, QCA9379, SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 425, SD 600, SD 625, SD 650/52, SD 808, SD 810, SD 820, SD 835, SD 845, SD 850, and SDX20, if WLAN FW receives the WMI_STA_SMPS_PARAM_CMDID ioctl in not-associated state, when the virtual channel handle is not assigned, the code doesn't check for NULL virtual channel handle, so an assert occurs.
