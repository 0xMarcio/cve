An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise 2018.2 - 2020.2.4. The CSRF prevention token is stored in a request cookie that is not annotated as HttpOnly. An attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary code in a user's browser could impose an arbitrary value for this token, allowing them to perform cross-site request forgery.
