### Description

The NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on multiple user privilege/security functions provided in versions up to, and including 4.3.17. This makes it possible for low-privileged attackers, like subscribers, to perform restricted actions that would be otherwise locked to a administrative-level user.
