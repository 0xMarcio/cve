### Description

The NEX-Forms. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure and modification of data in versions up to, and including 7.7.1 due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber level permissions and above to invoke these functions which can be used to perform actions like modify form submission records, deleting files, sending test emails, modifying plugin settings, and more.
