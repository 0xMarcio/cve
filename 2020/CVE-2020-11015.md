### Description

A vulnerability has been disclosed in thinx-device-api IoT Device Management Server before version 2.5.0. Device MAC address can be spoofed. This means initial registration requests without UDID and spoofed MAC address may pass to create new UDID with same MAC address. Full impact needs to be reviewed further. Applies to all (mostly ESP8266/ESP32) users. This has been fixed in firmware version 2.5.0.
