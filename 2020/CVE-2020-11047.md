### Description

In FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in autodetect_recv_bandwidth_measure_results. A malicious server can extract up to 8 bytes of client memory with a manipulated message by providing a short input and reading the measurement result data. This has been patched in 2.0.0.
