### Description

The Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the qppr_save_quick_redirect_ajax and qppr_delete_quick_redirect functions in versions up to, and including, 5.1.9. This makes it possible for low-privileged attackers to interact with the plugin settings and to create a redirect link that would forward all traffic to an external malicious website.
