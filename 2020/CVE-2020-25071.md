### Description

** DISPUTED ** Nifty Project Management Web Application 2020-08-26 allows XSS, via Add Task, that is rendered upon a Project Home visit. Note: It has been argued that this is not reproducible. "The original issue was that the task would be created and an alert would be shown on the screen. Now the task would be created, but the alert won't be executed as those attributes are now stripped."
