### Description

An issue was discovered in Gazie 7.32. A successful installation does not remove or block (or in any other way prevent use of) its own file /setup/install/setup.php, meaning that anyone can request it without authentication. This file allows arbitrary PHP file inclusion via a hidden_req POST parameter.
