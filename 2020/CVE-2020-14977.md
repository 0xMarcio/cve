### Description

An issue was discovered in F-Secure SAFE 17.7 on macOS. The XPC services use the PID to identify the connecting client, which allows an attacker to perform a PID reuse attack and connect to a privileged XPC service, and execute privileged commands on the system. NOTE: the attacker needs to execute code on an already compromised machine.
