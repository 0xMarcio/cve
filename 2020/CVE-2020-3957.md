### Description

VMware Fusion (11.x before 11.5.5), VMware Remote Console for Mac (11.x and prior) and VMware Horizon Client for Mac (5.x and prior) contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue in the service opener. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow attackers with normal user privileges to escalate their privileges to root on the system where Fusion, VMRC and Horizon Client are installed.
