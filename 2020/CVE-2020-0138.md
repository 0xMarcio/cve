### Description

In get_element_attr_rsp of btif_rc.cc, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to remote code execution if bluetoothtbd were used, which it isn't in typical Android platforms, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10Android ID: A-142878416
