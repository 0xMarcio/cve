### Description

Loading a DLL through an Uncontrolled Search Path Element in the Bosch Monitor Wall installer up to and including version 10.00.0164 potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. A prerequisite is that the victim is tricked into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory where the installer is started from.
