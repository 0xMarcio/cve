### Description

In Dreamacro Clash for Windows v0.11.4, an attacker could embed a malicious iframe in a website with a crafted URL that would launch the Clash Windows client and force it to open a remote SMB share. Windows will perform NTLM authentication when opening the SMB share and that request can be relayed (using a tool like responder) for code execution (or captured for hash cracking).
