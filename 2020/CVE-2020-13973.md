### Description

OWASP json-sanitizer before 1.2.1 allows XSS. An attacker who controls a substring of the input JSON, and controls another substring adjacent to a SCRIPT element in which the output is embedded as JavaScript, may be able to confuse the HTML parser as to where the SCRIPT element ends, and cause non-script content to be interpreted as JavaScript.
