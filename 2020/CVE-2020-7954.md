### Description

An issue was discovered in OpServices OpMon 9.3.2. Starting from the apache user account, it is possible to perform privilege escalation through the lack of correct configuration in the server's sudoers file, which by default allows the execution of programs (e.g. nmap) without the need for a password with sudo.
