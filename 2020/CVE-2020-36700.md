### Description

The Page Builder: KingComposer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.9.3. This is due to a security nonce being leaked in the '/wp-admin/index.php' page. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to change arbitrary WordPress options, delete arbitrary files/folders, and inject arbitrary content.
