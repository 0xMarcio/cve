### Description

In Solstice Pod before 3.0.3, the web services allow users to connect to them over unencrypted channels via the Browser Look-in feature. An attacker suitably positioned to view a legitimate user's network traffic could record and monitor their interactions with the web services and obtain any information the user supplies, including Administrator passwords and screen keys.
