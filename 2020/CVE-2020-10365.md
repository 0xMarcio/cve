### Description

LogicalDoc before 8.3.3 allows SQL Injection. LogicalDoc populates the list of available documents by querying the database. This list could be filtered by modifying some of the parameters. Some of them are not properly sanitized which could allow an authenticated attacker to perform arbitrary queries to the database.
