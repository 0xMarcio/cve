### Description

Users' enrollment capabilities were not being sufficiently checked in Moodle when they are restored into an existing course. This could lead to them unenrolling users without having permission to do so. Versions affected: 3.5 to 3.5.14, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.9 to 3.9.2 and earlier unsupported versions. Fixed in 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.
