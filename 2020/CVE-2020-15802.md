### Description

Devices supporting Bluetooth before 5.1 may allow man-in-the-middle attacks, aka BLURtooth. Cross Transport Key Derivation in Bluetooth Core Specification v4.2 and v5.0 may permit an unauthenticated user to establish a bonding with one transport, either LE or BR/EDR, and replace a bonding already established on the opposing transport, BR/EDR or LE, potentially overwriting an authenticated key with an unauthenticated key, or a key with greater entropy with one with less.
