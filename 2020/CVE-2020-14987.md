### Description

An issue was discovered in Bloomreach Experience Manager (brXM) 4.1.0 through 14.2.2. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because there is a mishandling of the capability for administrators to write and run Groovy scripts within the updater editor. An attacker must use an AST transforming annotation such as @Grab.
