### Description

A use-after-free in a logging library in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.20.111 and WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to v2.20.111 could have resulted in memory corruption, crashes and potentially code execution. This could have happened only if several events occurred together in sequence, including receiving an animated sticker while placing a WhatsApp video call on hold.
