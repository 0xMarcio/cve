### Description

goliath through 1.0.6 allows request smuggling attacks where goliath is used as a backend and a frontend proxy also being vulnerable. It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice. Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks.
