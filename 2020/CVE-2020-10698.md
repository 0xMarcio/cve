### Description

A flaw was found in Ansible Tower when running jobs. This flaw allows an attacker to access the stdout of the executed jobs which are run from other organizations. Some sensible data can be disclosed. However, critical data should not be disclosed, as it should be protected by the no_log flag when debugging is enabled. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4, Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.4.6.
