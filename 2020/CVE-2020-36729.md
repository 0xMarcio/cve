### Description

The 2J-SlideShow Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the 'twoj_slideshow_setup' function called via the wp_ajax_twoj_slideshow_setup AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.3.31. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers (Subscriber, or above level access) to allow attackers to perform otherwise restricted actions and subsequently deactivate any plugins on the blog.
