### Description

A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Dahua Smart Park Integrated Management Platform (also referred to as the Dahua Smart Campus Integrated Management Platform), affecting the SOAP-based GIS bitmap upload interface. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server via crafted SOAP requests, including executable JSP payloads. Successful exploitation may lead to remote code execution (RCE) and full compromise of the affected system. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to September 2023 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected range remains undefined. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-02-15 UTC.
