### Description

The GiveWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.33.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the give_stripe_disconnect_connect_stripe_account function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate the plugin's stripe integration settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
