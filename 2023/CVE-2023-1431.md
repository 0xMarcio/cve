### Description

The WP Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 4.6.3 due to the plugin saving shopping cart data exports in a publicly accessible location (/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/includes/admin/). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view information that should be limited to administrators only and can include data like first name, last name, email, address, IP Address, and more.
