### Description

The Essential Real Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'ajaxUploadFonts' function in versions up to, and including, 4.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
