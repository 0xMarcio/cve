### Description

A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity.With a specific request to webauth_operation.phpthat doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload and download arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity or confidentiality, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S8;  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S6;  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S5;  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S3;  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R3-S2;  *  22.4 versions prior to 22,4R2-S2, 22.4R3;  *  23.2 versions prior to 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.
