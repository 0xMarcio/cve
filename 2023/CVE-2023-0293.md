### Description

The Mediamatic â€“ Media Library Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change image categories, which it uses to arrange them in folder views.
