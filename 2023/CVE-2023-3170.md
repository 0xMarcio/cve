### Description

The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 4.2, used as a companion by the Newspaper and Newsmag themes from tagDiv, does not validate and escape some settings, which could allow users with Admin privileges to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
