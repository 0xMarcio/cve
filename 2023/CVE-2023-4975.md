### Description

The Website Builder by SeedProd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.15.13.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on functionality in the builder.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the stripe connect token via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
