### Description

The Ultimate Addons for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 3.1.29 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
