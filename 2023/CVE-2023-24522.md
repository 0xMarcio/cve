### Description

Due to insufficient input sanitization, SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP (Business Server Pages) - versions 700, 701, 702, 731, 740, allows an unauthenticated user to alter the current session of the user by injecting the malicious code over the network and gain access to the unintended data. This may lead to a limited impact on the confidentiality and the integrity of the application.
