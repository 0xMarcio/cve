### Description

Use After Free vulnerability in Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU memory processing operations. If the systemâ€™s memory is carefully prepared by the user, then this in turn could give them access to already freed memory.This issue affects Valhall GPU Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r47p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver: from r41p0 through r47p0.
