### Description

The WP EXtra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the register() function in versions up to, and including, 6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to modify the contents of the .htaccess files located in a site's root directory or /wp-content and /wp-includes folders and achieve remote code execution.
