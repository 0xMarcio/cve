### Description

The Image horizontal reel scroll slideshow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'ihrss-gallery' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 13.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
