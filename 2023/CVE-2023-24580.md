### Description

An issue was discovered in the Multipart Request Parser in Django 3.2 before 3.2.18, 4.0 before 4.0.10, and 4.1 before 4.1.7. Passing certain inputs (e.g., an excessive number of parts) to multipart forms could result in too many open files or memory exhaustion, and provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack.
