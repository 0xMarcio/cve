### Description

The CRM and Lead Management by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This is due to missing nonce validation in the vcita-callback.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
