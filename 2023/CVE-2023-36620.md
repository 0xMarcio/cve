### Description

An issue was discovered in the Boomerang Parental Control application before 13.83 for Android. The app is missing the android:allowBackup="false" attribute in the manifest. This allows the user to backup the internal memory of the app to a PC. This gives the user access to the API token that is used to authenticate requests to the API.
