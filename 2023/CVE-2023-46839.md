### Description

PCI devices can make use of a functionality called phantom functions,that when enabled allows the device to generate requests using the IDsof functions that are otherwise unpopulated.  This allows a device toextend the number of outstanding requests.Such phantom functions need an IOMMU context setup, but failure tosetup the context is not fatal when the device is assigned.  Notfailing device assignment when such failure happens can lead to theprimary device being assigned to a guest, while some of the phantomfunctions are assigned to a different domain.
