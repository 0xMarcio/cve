### Description

Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.11.7, an unauthorized actor can get access to user reset password tokens if they have the configure view permissions. The `/content-manager/relations` route does not remove private fields or ensure that they can't be selected. This issue is fixed in version 4.11.7.
