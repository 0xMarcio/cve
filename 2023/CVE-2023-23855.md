### Description

SAP Solution Manager - version 720, allows an authenticated attacker to redirect users to a malicious site due to insufficient URL validation. A successful attack could lead an attacker to read or modify the information or expose the user to a phishing attack. As a result, it has a low impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.
