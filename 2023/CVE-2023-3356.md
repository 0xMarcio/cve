### Description

The Subscribers Text Counter WordPress plugin before 1.7.1 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack, which also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping
