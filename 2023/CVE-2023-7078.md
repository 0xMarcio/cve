### Description

Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in wranglerÂ until 3.19.0), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.
