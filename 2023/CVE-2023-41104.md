### Description

libvmod-digest before 1.0.3, as used in Varnish Enterprise 6.0.x before 6.0.11r5, has an out-of-bounds memory access during base64 decoding, leading to both authentication bypass and information disclosure; however, the exact attack surface will depend on the particular VCL (Varnish Configuration Language) configuration in use.
