### Description

The WP Remote Users Sync plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data and addition of data due to a missing capability check on the 'refresh_logs_async' functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to view logs.
