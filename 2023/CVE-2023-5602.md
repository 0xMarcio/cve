### Description

The Social Media Share Buttons & Social Sharing Icons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions corresponding to AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
