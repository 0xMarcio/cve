### Description

Design document functions which receive a user http request object may expose authorization or session cookie headers of the user who accesses the document.These design document functions are:  *    list  *    show  *    rewrite  *    updateAn attacker can leak the session component using an HTML-like output, insert the session as an external resource (such as an image), or store the credential in a _local document with an "update" function.For the attack to succeed the attacker has to be able to insert the design documents into the database, then manipulate a user to access a function from that design document.Workaround: Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt to access or manipulate request object's headers
