### Description

1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. In version 1.4.3, an arbitrary file write vulnerability could lead to direct control of the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `SaveContentthat,It `recieves JSON data sent by users in the form of a POST request. And the lack of parameter filtering allows for arbitrary file write operations. Version 1.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.
