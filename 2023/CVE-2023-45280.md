### Description

Yamcs 5.8.6 allows XSS (issue 2 of 2). It comes with a Bucket as its primary storage mechanism. Buckets allow for the upload of any file. There's a way to upload an HTML file containing arbitrary JavaScript and then navigate to it. Once the user opens the file, the browser will execute the arbitrary JavaScript.
