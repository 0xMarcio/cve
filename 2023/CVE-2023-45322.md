### Description

libxml2 through 2.11.5 has a use-after-free that can only occur after a certain memory allocation fails. This occurs in xmlUnlinkNode in tree.c. NOTE: the vendor's position is "I don't think these issues are critical enough to warrant a CVE ID ... because an attacker typically can't control when memory allocations fail."
