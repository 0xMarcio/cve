### Description

The cacheservice API could be abused to inject parameters with SQL syntax which was insufficiently sanitized before getting executed as SQL statement. Attackers with access to a local or restricted network were able to perform arbitrary SQL queries, discovering other users cached data. We have improved the input check for API calls and filter for potentially malicious content. No publicly available exploits are known.
