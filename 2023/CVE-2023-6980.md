### Description

The WP SMS â€“ Messaging & SMS Notification for WordPress, WooCommerce, GravityForms, etc plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete subscribers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
