### Description

The Ziteboard Online Whiteboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'ziteboard' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 2.9.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
