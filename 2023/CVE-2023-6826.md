### Description

The E2Pdf plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'import_action' function in versions up to, and including, 1.20.25. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
