### Description

OpenTSDB is a open source, distributed, scalable Time Series Database (TSDB). OpenTSDB is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution vulnerability by writing user-controlled input to Gnuplot configuration file and running Gnuplot with the generated configuration. This issue has been patched in  commit `07c4641471c` and further refined in commit `fa88d3e4b`. These patches are available in the `2.4.2` release. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may disable Gunuplot via the config option`tsd.core.enable_ui = true` and remove the shell files `mygnuplot.bat` and `mygnuplot.sh`.
