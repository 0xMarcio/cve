### Description

Unofficial Mobile BankID Integration for WordPress lets users employ Mobile BankID to authenticate themselves on your WordPress site. Prior to 1.0.1, WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration is affected by a vulnerability classified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability, specifically impacting scenarios where an attacker can manipulate the database. If unauthorized actors gain access to the database, they could exploit this vulnerability to execute object injection attacks. This could lead to unauthorized code execution, data manipulation, or data exfiltration within the WordPress environment.  Users of the plugin should upgrade to version 1.0.1 (or later), where the serialization and deserialization of OrderResponse objects have been switched out to an array stored as JSON.  A possible workaround for users unable to upgrade immediately is to enforce stricter access controls on the database, ensuring that only trusted and authorized entities can modify data. Additionally, implementing monitoring tools to detect unusual database activities could help identify and mitigate potential exploitation attempts.
