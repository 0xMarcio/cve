### Description

Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier creates a temporary file in the default temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files when uploading a file parameter through the CLI, potentially allowing attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is used.
