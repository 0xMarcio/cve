### Description

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. Any user with edit rights can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of the included pages in the IncludedDocuments panel. The problem has been patched on XWiki 14.4.7, and 14.10.
