### Description

The Image Map Pro – Drag-and-drop Builder for Interactive Images – Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to a missing capability check on the ajax_store_save() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts.
