### Description

The FOX â€“ Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via currency options in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
