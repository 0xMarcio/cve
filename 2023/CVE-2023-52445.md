### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnectionUpon module load, a kthread is created targeting thepvr2_context_thread_func function, which may call pvr2_context_destroyand thus call kfree() on the context object. However, that might happenbefore the usb hub_event handler is able to notify the driver. Thispatch adds a sanity check before the invalid read reported by syzbot,within the context disconnection call stack.
