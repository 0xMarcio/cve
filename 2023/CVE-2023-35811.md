### Description

An issue was discovered in SugarCRM Enterprise before 11.0.6 and 12.x before 12.0.3. Two SQL Injection vectors have been identified in the REST API. By using crafted requests, custom SQL code can be injected through the REST API because of missing input validation. Regular user privileges can use used for exploitation. Editions other than Enterprise are also affected.
