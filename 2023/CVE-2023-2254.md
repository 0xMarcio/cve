### Description

The Ko-fi Button WordPress plugin before 1.3.3 does not properly some of its settings, which could allow high-privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup), and we consider it a low risk.
