### Description

** DISPUTED ** In OpenDDS through 3.27, there is a segmentation fault for a DataWriter with a large value of resource_limits.max_samples. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the product is not designed to handle a max_samples value that is too large for the amount of memory on the system.
