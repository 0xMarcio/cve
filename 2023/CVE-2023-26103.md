### Description

Versions of the package deno before 1.31.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to the upgradeWebSocket function, which contains regexes in the form of /s*,s*/, used for splitting the Connection/Upgrade header. A specially crafted Connection/Upgrade header can be used to significantly slow down a web socket server.
