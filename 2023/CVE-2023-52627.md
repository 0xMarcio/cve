### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:iio: adc: ad7091r: Allow users to configure device eventsAD7091R-5 devices are supported by the ad7091r-5 driver together withthe ad7091r-base driver. Those drivers declared iio events for notifyinguser space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limitregisters or above the values set in high limit registers.However, to configure iio events and their thresholds, a set of callbackfunctions must be implemented and those were not present until now.The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without theproper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernelbecause the pointers to the callback functions were not set.Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/writeevent thresholds and enable/disable event generation.Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices, also movethose from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reusedwhen support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.
