### Description

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ePO prior to 5.10 SP1 Update 1allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to potentially obtain access to an ePO administrator's session by convincing the authenticated ePO administrator to click on a carefully crafted link. This would lead to limited access to sensitive information and limited ability to alter some information in ePO.
