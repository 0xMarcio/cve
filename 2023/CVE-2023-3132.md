### Description

The MainWP Child plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 4.4.1.1 due to insufficient controls on the storage of back-up files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including the entire installations database if a backup occurs and the deletion of the back-up files fail.
