### Description

The Staff / Employee Business Directory for Active Directory WordPress plugin before 1.2.3 does not sanitize and escape data returned from the LDAP server before rendering it in the page, allowing users who can control their entries in the LDAP directory to inject malicious javascript which could be used against high-privilege users such as a site admin.
