### Description

The BackWPup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Plaintext Storage of Backup Destination Password in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to to the plugin improperly storing backup destination passwords in plaintext. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to retrieve the password from the password input field in the UI or from the options table where the password is stored.
