### Description

The Forminator WordPress plugin before 1.27.0 does not properly sanitize the redirect-url field in the form submission settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as an administrator to inject arbitrary web scripts even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in a multisite setup).
