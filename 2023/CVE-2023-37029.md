### Description

Magma versions <= 1.8.0 (fixed in v1.9 commit 08472ba98b8321f802e95f5622fa90fec2dea486) are susceptible to an assertion-based crash when an oversized NAS packet is received. An attacker may leverage this behavior to repeatedly crash the MME via either a compromised base station or via an unauthenticated cellphone within range of a base station managed by the MME, causing a denial of service.
