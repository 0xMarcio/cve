### Description

The Lead Generated WordPress Plugin, version <= 1.23, was affected by an unauthenticated insecure deserialization issue. The tve_labels parameter of the tve_api_form_submit action is passed to the PHP unserialize() function without being sanitized or verified, and as a result could lead to PHP object injection, which when combined with certain class implementations / gadget chains could be leveraged to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present.
