### Description

In SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Intelligence user interface) - version 420, some calls return json with wrong content type in the header of the response. As a result, a custom application that calls directly the jsp of Web Intelligence DHTML may be vulnerable to XSS attacks. On successful exploitation an attacker can cause limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.
