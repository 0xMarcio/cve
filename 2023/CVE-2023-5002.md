### Description

A flaw was found in pgAdmin. This issue occurs when the pgAdmin server HTTP API validates the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore. Versions of pgAdmin prior to 7.6 failed to properly control the server code executed on this API, allowing an authenticated user to run arbitrary commands on the server.
