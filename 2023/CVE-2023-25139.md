### Description

sprintf in the GNU C Library (glibc) 2.37 has a buffer overflow (out-of-bounds write) in some situations with a correct buffer size. This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.
