### Description

FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `nsc_rle_decompress_data` function. The Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because it processes `context->Planes` without  checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Should an attacker be able to leverage this vulnerability they may be able to cause a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
