### Description

The Calculated Fields Form WordPress plugin before 1.1.151 does not sanitise and escape some of its form settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
