### Description

The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the GetInvoiceDetail function in versions up to, and including, 1.2.89. This makes it possible for subscribers to view arbitrary invoices provided they can guess the order id and invoice id.
