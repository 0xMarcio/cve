### Description

The RapidExpCart WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not sanitize and escape the url parameter in the rapidexpcart endpoint before storing it and outputting it back in the page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability which could be used against high-privilege users such as admin, furthermore lack of csrf protection means an attacker can trick a logged in admin to perform the attack by submitting a hidden form.
