### Description

The Pickup | Delivery | Dine-in date time WordPress plugin through 1.0.9 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
