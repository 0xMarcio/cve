### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before sending a command[Why]We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn'tpowered on.[How]For functions that execute within a DC context or DC lock we canwrap the direct calls to dm_execute_dmub_cmd/list with code thatexits idle power optimizations and reallows once we're done withthe command submission on success.For DM direct submissions the DM will need to manage the enter/exitsequencing manually.We cannot invoke a DMCUB command directly within the DM executionhelper or we can deadlock.
