### Description

The "Buy Me a Coffee â€“ Button and Widget Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the recieve_post, bmc_disconnect, name_post, and widget_post functions in versions up to, and including, 3.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings, via a forged request granted the attacker can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
