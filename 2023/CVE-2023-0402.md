### Description

The Social Warfare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete post meta information and reset network access tokens.
