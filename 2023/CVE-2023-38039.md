### Description

When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers so thatthey can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API.However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it wouldaccept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an endless seriesof headers and eventually cause curl to run out of heap memory.
