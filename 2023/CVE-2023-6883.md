### Description

The Easy Social Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX functions in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying the plugin's Facebook and Instagram access tokens and updating group IDs.
