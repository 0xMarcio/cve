SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757, 791, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of path information provided by users, thus exploiting a directory traversal flaw in an available service to delete system files. In this attack, no data can be read but potentially critical OS files can be deleted making the system unavailable, causing significant impact on both availability and integrity
