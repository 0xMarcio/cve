### Description

A vulnerability in the Administrative XML Web Service (AXL) API of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web UI of the Self Care Portal. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.
