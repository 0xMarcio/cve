### Description

The InfiniteWP Client plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.3 via the multi-call backup option. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from a temporary SQL file via repeated GET requests during the limited time window of the backup process.
