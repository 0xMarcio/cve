### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: avoid online resizing failures due to oversized flex bgWhen we online resize an ext4 filesystem with a oversized flexbg_size,     mkfs.ext4 -F -G 67108864 $dev -b 4096 100M     mount $dev $dir     resize2fs $dev 16Gthe following WARN_ON is triggered:==================================================================WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 427 at mm/page_alloc.c:4402 __alloc_pages+0x411/0x550Modules linked in: sg(E)CPU: 0 PID: 427 Comm: resize2fs Tainted: G  E  6.6.0-rc5+ #314RIP: 0010:__alloc_pages+0x411/0x550Call Trace: <TASK> __kmalloc_large_node+0xa2/0x200 __kmalloc+0x16e/0x290 ext4_resize_fs+0x481/0xd80 __ext4_ioctl+0x1616/0x1d90 ext4_ioctl+0x12/0x20 __x64_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x150 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90==================================================================This is because flexbg_size is too large and the size of the new_group_dataarray to be allocated exceeds MAX_ORDER. Currently, the minimum value ofMAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the correspondingmaximum number of groups that can be allocated is: (PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER) / sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) â‰ˆ 21845And the value that is down-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore,this value is defined as MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups addedeach time does not exceed this value during resizing, and is added multipletimes to complete the online resizing. The difference is that the metadatain a flex_bg may be more dispersed.
