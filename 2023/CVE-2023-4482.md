### Description

The Auto Amazon Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the style parameter in versions up to, and including, 5.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
