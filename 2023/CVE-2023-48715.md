### Description

Tuleap is an open source suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. Prior to version 15.2.99.103 of Tuleap Community Edition and prior to versions 15.2-4 and 15.1-8 of Tuleap Enterprise Edition, the name of the releases are not properly escaped on the edition page of a release. A malicious user with the ability to create a FRS release could force a victim having write permissions in the FRS to execute uncontrolled code. Tuleap Community Edition 15.2.99.103, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 15.2-4, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 15.1-8 contain a fix for this issue.
