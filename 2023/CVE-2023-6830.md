### Description

The Formidable Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML injection in versions up to, and including, 6.7. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML code into form fields. When the form data is viewed by an administrator in the Entries View Page, the injected HTML code is rendered, potentially leading to admin area defacement or redirection to malicious websites.
