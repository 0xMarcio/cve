### Description

The WP Shortcodes Plugin â€” Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.13.3 via the su_meta shortcode due to missing validation on the user controlled keys 'key' and 'post_id'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to retrieve arbitrary post meta values which may contain sensitive information when combined with another plugin.
