### Description

Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:Â  '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'
