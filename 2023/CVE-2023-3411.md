### Description

The Image Map Pro – Drag-and-drop Builder for Interactive Images – Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ajax_store_save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
