### Description

An issue was discovered in Webmin 2.021. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Bypass vulnerability was discovered in the file upload functionality. Normally, the application restricts the upload of certain file types such as .svg, .php, etc., and displays an error message if a prohibited file type is detected. However, by following certain steps, an attacker can bypass these restrictions and inject malicious code.
