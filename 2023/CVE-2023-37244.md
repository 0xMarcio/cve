### Description

The affected AutomationManager.AgentService.exe application contains a TOCTOU race condition vulnerability that allows standard users to create a pseudo-symlink at C:\ProgramData\N-Able Technologies\AutomationManager\Temp, which could be leveraged by an attacker to manipulate the process into performing arbitrary file deletions. We recommend upgrading to version 2.91.0.0
