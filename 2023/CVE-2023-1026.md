### Description

The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the listPostsCategory function in versions up to, and including, 4.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to get post listings by category as long as those posts are published. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role.
