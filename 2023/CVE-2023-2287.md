### Description

The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle WordPress plugin before 2.10.24 does not limit URLs which may be used for the stock photo import feature, allowing the user to specify arbitrary URLs. This leads to a server-side request forgery as the user may force the server to access any URL of their choosing.
