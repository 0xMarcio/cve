### Description

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key andinitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncationor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() orEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed afterthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter,within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentiallycausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphersand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result inloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38Dsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES inGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV willproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memoryexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as securitycritical.Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operationand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely thatapplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing sincedecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarlyvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application beingvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable thenthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed thisissue as Moderate severity overall.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this becausethe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.
