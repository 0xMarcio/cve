### Description

SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal - version 7.50, does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs over the network, resulting in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, therefore changing the scope of the attack. On successful exploitation, an attacker can view or modify information causing a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.
