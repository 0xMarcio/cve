### Description

Cacheservice did not correctly check if relative cache object were pointing to the defined absolute location when accessing resources. An attacker with access to the database and a local or restricted network would be able to read arbitrary local file system resources that are accessible by the services system user account. We have improved path validation and make sure that any access is contained to the defined root directory. No publicly available exploits are known.
