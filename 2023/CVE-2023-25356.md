### Description

CoreDial sipXcom up to and including 21.04 is vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command. XMPP users are able to inject arbitrary arguments into a system command, which can be used to read files from, and write files to, the sipXcom server. This can also be leveraged to gain remote command execution.
