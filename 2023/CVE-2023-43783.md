### Description

Cadence through 0.9.2 2023-08-21 uses an Insecure /tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg Temporary File. The filename is used even if it has been created by a local adversary before Cadence started. The adversary can leverage this to create or overwrite files via a symlink attack. In some kernel configurations, code injection into the Wine registry is possible.
