### Description

Ghost 5.35.0 allows authorization bypass: contributors can view draft posts of other users, which is arguably inconsistent with a security policy in which a contributor's draft can only be read by editors until published by an editor. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior has no security impact.
