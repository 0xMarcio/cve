### Description

In the module "Product Catalog (CSV, Excel, XML) Export PRO" (exportproducts) in versions up to 4.1.1 from MyPrestaModules for PrestaShop, a guest can download personal information without restriction by performing a path traversal attack. Due to a lack of permissions control and a lack of control in the path name construction, a guest can perform a path traversal to view all files on the information system.
