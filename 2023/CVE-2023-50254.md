### Description

Deepin Linux's default document reader `deepin-reader` software suffers from a serious vulnerability in versions prior to 6.0.7 due to a design flaw that leads to remote command execution via crafted docx document. This is a file overwrite vulnerability. Remote code execution (RCE) can be achieved by overwriting files like .bash_rc, .bash_login, etc. RCE will be triggered when the user opens the terminal. Version 6.0.7 contains a patch for the issue.
