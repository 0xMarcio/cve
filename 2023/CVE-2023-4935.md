### Description

The BEAR for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the create_profile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create profiles via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
