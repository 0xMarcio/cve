### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: gadget: u_audio: don't let userspace block driver unbindIn the unbind callback for f_uac1 and f_uac2, a call to snd_card_free()via g_audio_cleanup() will disconnect the card and then wait for allresources to be released, which happens when the refcount falls to zero.Since userspace can keep the refcount incremented by not closing therelevant file descriptor, the call to unbind may block indefinitely.This can cause a deadlock during reboot, as evidenced by the followingblocked task observed on my machine:  task:reboot  state:D stack:0   pid:2827  ppid:569    flags:0x0000000c  Call trace:   __switch_to+0xc8/0x140   __schedule+0x2f0/0x7c0   schedule+0x60/0xd0   schedule_timeout+0x180/0x1d4   wait_for_completion+0x78/0x180   snd_card_free+0x90/0xa0   g_audio_cleanup+0x2c/0x64   afunc_unbind+0x28/0x60   ...   kernel_restart+0x4c/0xac   __do_sys_reboot+0xcc/0x1ec   __arm64_sys_reboot+0x28/0x30   invoke_syscall+0x4c/0x110   ...The issue can also be observed by opening the card with arecord andthen stopping the process through the shell before unbinding:  # arecord -D hw:UAC2Gadget -f S32_LE -c 2 -r 48000 /dev/null  Recording WAVE '/dev/null' : Signed 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Stereo  ^Z[1]+  Stopped                    arecord -D hw:UAC2Gadget -f S32_LE -c 2 -r 48000 /dev/null  # echo gadget.0 > /sys/bus/gadget/drivers/configfs-gadget/unbind  (observe that the unbind command never finishes)Fix the problem by using snd_card_free_when_closed() instead, which willstill disconnect the card as desired, but defer the task of freeing theresources to the core once userspace closes its file descriptor.
