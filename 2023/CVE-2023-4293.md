### Description

The Premium Packages - Sell Digital Products Securely plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 5.7.4 due to insufficient restriction on the 'wpdmpp_update_profile' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'profile[role]' parameter during a profile update.
