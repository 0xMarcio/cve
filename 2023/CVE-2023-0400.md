### Description

The protection bypass vulnerability in DLP for Windows 11.9.x is addressed in version 11.10.0. This allowed a local user to bypass DLP controls when uploading sensitive data from a mapped drive into a web email client. Loading from a local driver was correctly prevented. Versions prior to 11.9 correctly detected and blocked the attempted upload of sensitive data.
