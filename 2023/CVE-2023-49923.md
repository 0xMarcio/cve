### Description

 An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby the Documents API of App Search logged the raw contents of indexed documents at INFO log level. Depending on the contents of such documents, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the App Search logs. Elastic has released 8.11.2 and 7.17.16 that resolves this issue by changing the log level at which these are logged to DEBUG, which is disabled by default.
