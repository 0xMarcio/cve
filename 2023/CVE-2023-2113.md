### Description

The Autoptimize WordPress plugin before 3.1.7 does not sanitise and escape the settings imported from a previous export, allowing high privileged users (such as an administrator) to inject arbitrary javascript into the admin panel, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disabled, such as in a multisite setup.
