### Description

D-Link DAP-1360 webproc COMM_MakeCustomMsg Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1360 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the handling of requests to the /cgi-bin/webproc endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.. Was ZDI-CAN-18454.
