### Description

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. Rights added to a document are not taken into account for viewing it once it's deleted. Note that this vulnerability only impact deleted documents that where containing view rights: the view rights provided on a space of a deleted document are properly checked. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10 by checking the rights of current user: only admin and deleter of the document are allowed to view it.
