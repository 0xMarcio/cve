### Description

The EventON PRO - WordPress Virtual Event Calendar Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_test_email function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send test emails to arbitrary email addresses via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
