### Description

Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cachefor a given region.  This is, for instance, used when allocatingguest memory to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing)have reached memory before handing over the page to a guest.Unfortunately, the arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and wouldthen result to skip the cache cleaning/invalidation.  Therefore thereis no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.This undefined behavior was meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but theapproach was not sufficient.
