### Description

The Download Manager WordPress plugin before 3.2.71 does not adequately validate passwords for password-protected files. Upon validation, a master key is generated and exposed to the user, which may be used to download any password-protected file on the server, allowing a user to download any file with the knowledge of any one file's password.
