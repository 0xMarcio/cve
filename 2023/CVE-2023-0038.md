### Description

The "Survey Maker â€“ Best WordPress Survey Plugin" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via survey answers in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts when submitting quizzes that will execute whenever a user accesses the submissions page.
