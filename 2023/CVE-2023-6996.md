### Description

The Display custom fields in the frontend â€“ Post and User Profile Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Code Injection via the plugin's vg_display_data shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 due to insufficient input validation and restriction on access to that shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to call arbitrary functions and execute code.
