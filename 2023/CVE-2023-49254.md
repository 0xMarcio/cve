### Description

Authenticated user can execute arbitrary commands in the context of the root user by providing payload in the "destination" field of the network test tools. This is similar to the vulnerability CVE-2021-28151 mitigated on the user interface level by blacklisting characters with JavaScript, however, it can still be exploited by sending POST requests directly.
