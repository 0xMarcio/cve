### Description

ActiveSupport::EncryptedFile writes contents that will be encrypted to atemporary file.  The temporary file's permissions are defaulted to the user'scurrent `umask` settings, meaning that it's possible for other users on thesame system to read the contents of the temporary file.Attackers that have access to the file system could possibly read the contentsof this temporary file while a user is editing it.All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of theworkarounds immediately.
