### Description

Due to insufficient input validation, SAP NetWeaver AS for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757, 789, 790, allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a crafted URL to a user, and by clicking the URL, the tricked user accesses SAP and might be directed with the response to somewhere out-side SAP and enter sensitive data. This could cause a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.
