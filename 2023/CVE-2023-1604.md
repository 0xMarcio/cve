### Description

The Short URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the configuration_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and import redirects, including comments containing cross-site scripting as detailed in CVE-2023-1602, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
