### Description

The FACSChorus workstation does not prevent physical access to its PCI express (PCIe) slots, which could allow a threat actor to insert a PCI card designed for memory capture. A threat actor can then isolate sensitive information such as a BitLocker encryption key from a dump of the workstation RAM during startup.
