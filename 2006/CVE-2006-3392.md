### Description

Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using "..%01" sequences, which bypass the removal of "../" sequences before bytes such as "%01" are removed from the filename.  NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274.
