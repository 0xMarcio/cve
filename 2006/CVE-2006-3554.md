### Description

Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in MKPortal 1.0.1 Final allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the language cookie, as demonstrated by using a gl_session cookie to inject PHP sequences into the error.log file, which is then included by index.php with malicious commands accessible by the ind parameter.
