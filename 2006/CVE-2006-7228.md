### Description

Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.7 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a regular expression that involves large (1) min, (2) max, or (3) duplength values that cause an incorrect length calculation and trigger a buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-7227.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
