### Description

The show_elog_list function in elogd.c in elog 2.6.2 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by attempting to access a logbook whose name begins with "global," which results in a NULL pointer dereference.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
