### Description

** DISPUTED **  Microsoft Terminal Server, when running an application session with the "Start program at logon" and "Override settings from user profile and Client Connection Manager wizard" options, allows local users to execute arbitrary code by forcing an Explorer error.  NOTE: a third-party researcher has stated that the options are "a convenience to users" and were not intended to restrict execution of arbitrary code.
