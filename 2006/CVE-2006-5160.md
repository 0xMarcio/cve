### Description

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox have unspecified vectors and impact, as claimed during ToorCon 2006.  NOTE: the vendor and original researchers have released a follow-up comment disputing this issue, in which one researcher states that "I have no undisclosed Firefox vulnerabilities. The person who was speaking with me made this claim, and I honestly have no idea if he has them or not.
