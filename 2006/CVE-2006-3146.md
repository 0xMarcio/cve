### Description

The TOSRFBD.SYS driver for Toshiba Bluetooth Stack 4.00.29 and earlier on Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) via a L2CAP echo request that triggers an out-of-bounds memory access, similar to "Ping o' Death" and as demonstrated by BlueSmack.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported for 4.00.23.
