### Description

Oracle 10g R2 and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to trigger internal errors, and possibly have other impacts, via an "alter session set events" command with invalid arguments.  NOTE: this issue was originally disputed by a third party, but the dispute was retracted.  NOTE: this issue was called an "integer overflow" in the original source, but this might be incorrect.
