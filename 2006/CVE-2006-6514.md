### Description

Winamp Web Interface (Wawi) 7.5.13 and earlier uses an insufficient comparison to determine whether a directory is located below the application's root directory, which allows remote authenticated users to access certain other directories if the name of the root directory is a substring of the name of the target directory, as demonstrated by accessing C:\folder2 when the root directory is C:\folder.
