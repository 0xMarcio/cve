### Description

Apple Safari 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute code via an invalid FRAME tag, possibly due to (1) multiple SCROLLING attributes with no values, or (2) a SRC attribute with no value.  NOTE: due to lack of diagnosis by the researcher, it is unclear which vector is responsible.
