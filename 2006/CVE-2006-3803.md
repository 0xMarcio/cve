### Description

Race condition in the JavaScript garbage collection in Mozilla Firefox 1.5 before 1.5.0.5, Thunderbird before 1.5.0.5, and SeaMonkey before 1.0.3 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by causing the garbage collector to delete a temporary variable while it is still being used during the creation of a new Function object.
