### Description

SSL VPN Client in Cisco Secure Desktop before 3.1.1.45, when configured to spawn a web browser after a successful connection, stores sensitive browser session information in a directory outside of the CSD vault and does not restrict the user from saving files outside of the vault, which is not cleared after the VPN connection terminates and allows local users to read unencrypted data.
