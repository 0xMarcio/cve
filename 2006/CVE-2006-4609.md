### Description

** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the Content Management module ("Content manager") for PHProjekt 0.6.1, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the path_pre parameter in (1) cm_lib.inc.php, (2) doc/br.edithelp.php, (3) doc/de.edithelp.php, (4) doc/ct.edithelp.php, (5) userrating.php, and (6) listing.php, a different set of vectors than CVE-2006-4204.  NOTE: a third-party researcher has disputed the impact of the cm_lib.inc.php vector, stating that it is limited to local file inclusion. CVE analysis as of 20060905 concurs, although use of ftp URLs is also possible. The remaining five vectors have also been disputed by the same third party, stating that the path_pre variable is initialized before it is used.
