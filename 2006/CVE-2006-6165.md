### Description

ld.so in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and possibly other BSD distributions does not remove certain harmful environment variables, which allows local users to gain privileges by passing certain environment variables to loading processes.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, stating that it is the responsibility of the application to properly sanitize the environment
