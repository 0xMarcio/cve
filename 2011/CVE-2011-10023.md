### Description

MJM QuickPlayer (likely now referred to as MJM Player) version 2010 contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability triggered by opening a malicious .s3m music file. The flaw occurs due to improper bounds checking in the file parser, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code. Exploitation is achieved via a crafted payload that bypasses DEP and ASLR protections using ROP techniques, and requires user interaction to open the file.
