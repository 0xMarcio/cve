### Description

Kaillera Server version 0.86 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service condition triggered by sending a malformed UDP packet after the initial handshake. Once a client sends a valid HELLO0.83 packet and receives a response, any subsequent malformed packet causes the server to crash and become unresponsive. This flaw stems from improper input validation in the serverâ€™s UDP packet handler, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to disrupt service availability.
