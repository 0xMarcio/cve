### Description

Magix Musik Maker 16 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of .mmm arrangement files. The vulnerability arises from an unsafe strcpy() operation that fails to validate input length, allowing attackers to overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH). By crafting a malicious .mmm file, an attacker can trigger the overflow when the file is opened, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability was remediated in version 17.
