### Description

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in MPlayer Lite r33064 due to improper bounds checking when handling M3U playlist files containing long http:// URL entries. An attacker can craft a malicious .m3u file with a specially formatted URL that triggers a stack overflow when processed by the player, particularly via drag-and-drop interaction. This flaw allows for control of the execution flow through SEH overwrite and a DEP bypass using a ROP chain that leverages known gadgets in loaded DLLs. Successful exploitation may result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user.
