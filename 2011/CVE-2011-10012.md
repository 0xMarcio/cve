### Description

NetOp (now part of Impero Software) Remote Control Client v9.5 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing .dws configuration files. If a .dws file contains a string longer than 520 bytes, the application fails to perform proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code when the file is opened.
