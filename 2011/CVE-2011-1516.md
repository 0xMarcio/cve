### Description

The kSBXProfileNoNetwork and kSBXProfileNoInternet sandbox profiles in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.x through 10.7.x do not propagate restrictions to all created processes, which allows remote attackers to access network resources via a crafted application, as demonstrated by use of osascript to send Apple events to the launchd daemon, a related issue to CVE-2008-7303.
