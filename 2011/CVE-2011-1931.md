### Description

sp5xdec.c in the Sunplus SP5X JPEG decoder in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 0.6.3 and libav through 0.6.2, as used in VideoLAN VLC media player 1.1.9 and earlier and other products, performs a write operation outside the bounds of an unspecified array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed AMV file.
