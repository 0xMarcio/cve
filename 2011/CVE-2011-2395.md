### Description

The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in Cisco IOS on unspecified switches allows remote attackers to bypass the Router Advertisement Guarding functionality via a fragmented IPv6 packet in which the Router Advertisement (RA) message is contained in the second fragment, as demonstrated by (1) a packet in which the first fragment contains a long Destination Options extension header or (2) a packet in which the first fragment contains an ICMPv6 Echo Request message.
