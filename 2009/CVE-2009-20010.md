### Description

Dogfood CRM version 2.0.10 contains a remote command execution vulnerability in the spell.php script used by its mail subsystem. The vulnerability arises from unsanitized user input passed via a POST request to the data parameter, which is processed by the underlying shell without adequate escaping. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands and execute them on the server. The flaw is exploitable without authentication and was discovered by researcher LSO.
