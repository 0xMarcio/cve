### Description

The js_watch_set function in js/src/jsdbgapi.cpp in the JavaScript engine in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .js file, related to a "memory safety bug." NOTE: this was originally reported as affecting versions before 3.0.13.
