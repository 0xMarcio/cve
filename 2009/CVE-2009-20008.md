### Description

Green Dam Youth Escort version 3.17 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing overly long URLs. The flaw resides in the URL filtering component, which fails to properly validate input length before copying user-supplied data into a fixed-size buffer. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage containing a long URL, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
