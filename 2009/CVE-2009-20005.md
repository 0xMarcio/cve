### Description

A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the UtilConfigHome.csp endpoint of InterSystems Cach√© 2009.1. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing an oversized argument to the .csp handler. Due to insufficient bounds checking, the input overflows a stack buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite control structures and execute arbitrary code. It is unknown if this vulnerability was patched and an affected version range remains undefined.
