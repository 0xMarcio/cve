### Description

PostgreSQL 7.4.x before 7.4.27, 8.0.x before 8.0.23, 8.1.x before 8.1.19, 8.2.x before 8.2.15, 8.3.x before 8.3.9, and 8.4.x before 8.4.2 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which (1) allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL-based PostgreSQL servers via a crafted server certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, and (2) allows remote attackers to bypass intended client-hostname restrictions via a crafted client certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
