### Description

Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 5.0u55, 6u65, and 7u45, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Serviceability.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the issue is related to throwing of an incorrect exception when SnmpStatusException should have been used in the SNMP implementation, which allows attackers to escape the sandbox.
