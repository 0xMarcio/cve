### Description

Working Resources Inc. BadBlue Enterprise Edition 1.7 through 1.74 attempts to restrict administrator actions to the IP address of the local host, but does not provide additional authentication, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a web page containing an HTTP POST request that accesses the dir.hts page on the localhost and adds an entire hard drive to be shared.
