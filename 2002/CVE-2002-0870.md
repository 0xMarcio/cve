### Description

The original patch for the Cisco Content Service Switch 11000 Series authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2001-0622) was incomplete, which still allows remote attackers to gain additional privileges by directly requesting the web management URL instead of navigating through the interface, possibly via a variant of the original attack, as identified by Cisco bug ID CSCdw08549.
