### Description

LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Manage User Access" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "bill_name" parameter when creating a new bill. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code when visiting the "Bill Access" dropdown in the user's "Manage Access" page, potentially compromising user sessions and allowing unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.
