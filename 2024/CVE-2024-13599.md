### Description

The LearnPress â€“ WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.7.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of a lesson name. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with LP Instructor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
