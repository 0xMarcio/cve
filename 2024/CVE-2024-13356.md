### Description

The DSGVO All in one for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the user_remove_form.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete admin user accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
