### Description

macro-pdfviewer is a PDF Viewer Macro for XWiki using Mozilla pdf.js. Users with edit rights can access restricted PDF attachments using the PDF Viewer macro, just by passing the attachment URL as the value of the ``file`` parameter. Users with view rights can access restricted PDF attachments if they are shown on public pages where the PDF Viewer macro is called using the attachment URL instead of its reference. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.5.1.
