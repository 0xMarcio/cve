### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: venus: fix use after free bug in venus_remove due to race conditionin venus_probe, core->work is bound with venus_sys_error_handler, which isused to handle error. The code use core->sys_err_done to make sync work.The core->work is started in venus_event_notify.If we call venus_remove, there might be an unfished work. The possiblesequence is as follows:CPU0                  CPU1                     |venus_sys_error_handlervenus_remove         |hfi_destroy	 		 |venus_hfi_destroy	 |kfree(hdev);	     |                     |hfi_reinit					 |venus_hfi_queues_reinit                     |//use hdevFix it by canceling the work in venus_remove.
