### Description

The Rank Math SEO  WordPress plugin before 1.0.219 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow users with access to the General Settings (by default admin, however such access can be given to lower roles via the Role Manager feature of the Rank Math SEO  WordPress plugin before 1.0.219) to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
