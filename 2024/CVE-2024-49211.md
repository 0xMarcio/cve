### Description

Reflected XSS was discovered in a Dashboard Listing Archer Platform UX page in Archer Platform 6.x before version 2024.08. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking a victim application user into supplying malicious HTML or JavaScript code to the vulnerable web application; the malicious code is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.
