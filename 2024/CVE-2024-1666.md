### Description

In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.0, an authorization flaw exists that allows unauthorized radar creation. The vulnerability stems from the lack of server-side checks to verify if a user is on a free account during the radar creation process, which is only enforced in the web UI. As a result, attackers can bypass the intended account upgrade requirement by directly sending crafted requests to the server, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of radars without payment.
