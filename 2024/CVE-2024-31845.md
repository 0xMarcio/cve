### Description

An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4. The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs. The web application writes logs using a GET query string parameter. This parameter can be modified by an attacker, so that every action he performs is attributed to a different user. This can be exploited without authentication.
