### Description

HaloITSM versions up to 2.146.1 are affected by a SAML XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) vulnerability. When having a SAML integration configured, anonymous actors could impersonate arbitrary HaloITSM users by just knowing their email address. HaloITSM versions past 2.146.1 (and patches starting from 2.143.61 ) fix the mentioned vulnerability.
