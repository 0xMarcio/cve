### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: uvcvideo: Fix crash during unbind if gpio unit is in useWe used the wrong device for the device managed functions. We used theusb device, when we should be using the interface device.If we unbind the driver from the usb interface, the cleanup functionsare never called. In our case, the IRQ is never disabled.If an IRQ is triggered, it will try to access memory sections that arealready free, causing an OOPS.We cannot use the function devm_request_threaded_irq here. The devm_*clean functions may be called after the main structure is released byuvc_delete.Luckily this bug has small impact, as it is only affected by deviceswith gpio units and the user has to unbind the device, a disconnect willnot trigger this error.
