### Description

Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager. The current implementation of token parsing does not adequately validate CSRF tokens when users send messages to one another. This vulnerability could be exploited to forge CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to send messages to any user, including administrators, if they interact with a malicious request. This issue has been addressed in version 7.0.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
