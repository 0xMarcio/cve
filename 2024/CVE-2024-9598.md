### Description

The AMP for WP â€“ Accelerated Mobile Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.99.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'proxy' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send the logged in user's cookies to their own server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
