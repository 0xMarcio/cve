### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial numberOn MSM8916 devices, the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and doesnot change across individual devices. It's always:  db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number  2644893864The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does nothave support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is anexisting check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it'snot correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to makesure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparingwith the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfostruct in SMEM.Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of thefield is also taken into account.
