### Description

The AI Power: Complete AI Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the wpaicg_save_image_media function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.96. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload image files and embed shortcode attributes in the image_alt value that will execute when sending a POST request to the attachment page.
