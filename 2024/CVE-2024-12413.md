### Description

The MarketKing â€” Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several functions like 'marketking_delete_team_member', 'marketkingrejectuser', 'marketking_save_profile_settings', and many more in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.00. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete users, update settings, approve users, and more.
