### Description

Press, a Frappe custom app that runs Frappe Cloud, manages infrastructure, subscription, marketplace, and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The password could be reset by anyone who have access to the mail inbox circumventing the 2FA. Even though they wouldn't be able to login by bypassing the 2FA. Only users who have enabled 2FA are affected. Commit ba0007c28ac814260f836849bc07d29beea7deb6 patches this bug.
