### Description

The HTML5 Video Player â€“ mp4 Video Player Plugin and Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on multiple functions called via the 'h5vp_ajax_handler' ajax action in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call these functions to manipulate data.
