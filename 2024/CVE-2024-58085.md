### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()syzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at tomoyo_write_control(),for one can write a very very long line without new line character. To fixthis warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE,for practically a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the"too small to fail" memory-allocation rule applies.One might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but suchrequest will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separatelyreturning -EINVAL when a line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant.There is no need to distinguish over-32KB and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.
