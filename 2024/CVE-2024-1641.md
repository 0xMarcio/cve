### Description

The Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'accordions_duplicate_post_as_draft' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.96. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to duplicate arbitrary posts, allowing access to the contents of password-protected posts.
