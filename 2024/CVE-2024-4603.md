### Description

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be veryslow.Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters mayexperience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checkedhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial ofService.The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() performvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long timeif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow usingpublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signatureverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limitthe modulus size when performing the checks.An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could bevulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys soonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the `-check` option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.
