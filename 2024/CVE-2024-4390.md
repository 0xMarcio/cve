### Description

The Slider and Carousel slider by Depicter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary Nonce Generation in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access and above, to generate a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function. This could be used to invoke functionality that is protected only by nonce checks.
