### Description

The WPify Woo Czech plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the maybe_send_to_packeta function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain shipping details for orders as long as the order number is known.
