### Description

The Visual Website Collaboration, Feedback & Project Management â€“ Atarim plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the process_wpfeedback_misc_options() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugins settings which can also be leveraged to gain access to the plugin's settings.
