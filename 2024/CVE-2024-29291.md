### Description

** DISPUTED ** An issue in Laravel Framework 8 through 11 might allow a remote attacker to discover database credentials in storage/logs/laravel.log. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties because the owner of a Laravel Framework installation can choose to have debugging logs, but needs to set the access control appropriately for the type of data that may be logged.
