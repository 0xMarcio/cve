### Description

The GeoDirectory â€“ WP Business Directory Plugin and Classified Listings Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the display_name profile parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.97 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
