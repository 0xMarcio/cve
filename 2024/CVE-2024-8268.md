### Description

The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized code execution due to insufficient filtering on callable methods/functions via the ajax_request() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to call arbitrary functions that can be leverage for privilege escalation by changing user's passwords.
