### Description

KioWare for Windows (versions all through 8.34) allows to escape the environment by downloading PDF files, which then by default are opened in an external PDF viewer. By using built-in functions of that viewer it is possible to launch a web browser, search through local files and, subsequently, launch any program with user privileges.
