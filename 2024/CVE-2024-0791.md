### Description

The WOLF â€“ WordPress Posts Bulk Editor and Manager Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access, modification or loss of data due to a missing capability check on the wpbe_create_new_term, wpbe_update_tax_term, and wpbe_delete_tax_term functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to create, delete or modify taxonomy terms.
