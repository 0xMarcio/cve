### Description

A malicious insider exploiting this vulnerability can circumvent existing security controls put in place by the organization. On the contrary, if the victim is legitimately using the temporary bypass to reach out to the Internet for retrieving application and system updates, a remote device could target it and undo the bypass, thereby denying the victim access to the update service, causing it to fail.
