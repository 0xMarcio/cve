### Description

The MultiVendorX â€“ The Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation/de-escalation and account takeover due to an insufficient capability check on the update_item_permissions_check and create_item_permissions_check functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the password of any user with the vendor role, create new users with the vendor role, and demote other users like administrators to the vendor role.
