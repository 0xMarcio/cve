### Description

The Super Backup & Clone - Migrate for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and a missing capability check on the ibk_restore_migrate_check() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
