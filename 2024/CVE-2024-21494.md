### Description

All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass by Spoofing via the X-Forwarded-For header due to improper input sanitization. An attacker can spoof an IP address used in the user identity module (/whoami API endpoint). This could lead to unauthorized access if the system trusts this spoofed IP address.
