### Description

The Featured Image Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized image upload due to a missing capability check on the fig_save_after_generate_image function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary images to a post-related gallery.
