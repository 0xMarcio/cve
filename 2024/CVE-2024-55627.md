### Description

Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.8, a specially crafted TCP stream can lead to a very large buffer overflow while being zero-filled during initialization with memset due to an unsigned integer underflow. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.8.
