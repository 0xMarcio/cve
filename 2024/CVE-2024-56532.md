### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: us122l: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnectionThe USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-longwaiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() atdisconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence itcan take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, whichmay trigger a soft lockup.An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() withsnd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately whilethe release of resources is done asynchronously by the card devicerelease at the last close.The loop of us122l->mmap_count check is dropped as well.  The check isuseless for the asynchronous operation with *_when_closed().
