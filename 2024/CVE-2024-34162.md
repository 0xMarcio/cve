### Description

The web interface of the affected devices is designed to hide the LDAP credentials even for administrative users. But configuring LDAP authentication to "SIMPLE", the device communicates with the LDAP server in clear-text. The LDAP password can be retrieved from this clear-text communication. As for the details of affected product names, model numbers, and versions, refer to the information provided by the respective vendors listed under [References].
