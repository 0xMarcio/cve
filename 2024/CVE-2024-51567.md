### Description

upgrademysqlstatus in databases/views.py in CyberPanel (aka Cyber Panel) before 5b08cd6 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands via /dataBases/upgrademysqlstatus by bypassing secMiddleware (which is only for a POST request) and using shell metacharacters in the statusfile property, as exploited in the wild in October 2024 by PSAUX. Versions through 2.3.6 and (unpatched) 2.3.7 are affected.
