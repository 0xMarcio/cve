### Description

The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.15 via the Project Task List ('/wp-json/pm/v2/projects/1/task-lists') REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including the hashed passwords of project owners (e.g. adminstrators).
