### Description

An issue was discovered in TitanHQ SpamTitan Email Security Gateway 8.00.x before 8.00.101 and 8.01.x before 8.01.14. The file quarantine.php within the SpamTitan interface allows unauthenticated users to trigger account-level actions using a crafted GET request. Notably, when a non-existent email address is provided as part of the email parameter, SpamTitan will automatically create a user record and associate quarantine settings with it - all without requiring authentication.
