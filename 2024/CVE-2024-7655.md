### Description

The Community by PeepSo â€“ Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
