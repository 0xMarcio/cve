### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.109, an attacker could determine whether or not another user exists on the instance by deciphering the error response that they would likely receive from the instance when they attempt to log in. This disclosure could then lead to additional brute-force password-guessing attacks. This vulnerability would require that the Splunk platform instance uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication scheme.
