### Description

Shopware is an open commerce platform. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the `aggregations` object. The `name` field in this `aggregations` object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using SQL parameters. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.
