### Description

The WP Easy Gallery â€“ WordPress Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions hooked via AJAX like wpeg_settings and wpeg_add_gallery in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to modify galleries.
