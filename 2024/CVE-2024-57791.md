### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/smc: check return value of sock_recvmsg when draining clc dataWhen receiving clc msg, the field length in smc_clc_msg_hdr indicates thelength of msg should be received from network and the value should not befully trusted as it is from the network. Once the value of length exceedsthe value of buflen in function smc_clc_wait_msg it may run into deadloopwhen trying to drain the remaining data exceeding buflen.This patch checks the return value of sock_recvmsg when draining data incase of deadloop in draining.
