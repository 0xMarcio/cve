### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udmabuf: fix memory leak on last export_udmabuf() error pathIn export_udmabuf(), if dma_buf_fd() fails because the FD table is full, adma_buf owning the udmabuf has already been created; but the error handlingin udmabuf_create() will tear down the udmabuf without doing anything aboutthe containing dma_buf.This leaves a dma_buf in memory that contains a dangling pointer; thoughthat doesn't seem to lead to anything bad except a memory leak.Fix it by moving the dma_buf_fd() call out of export_udmabuf() so that wecan give it different error handling.Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21("udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios"); but the memory leakseems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.
