### Description

The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wfu_ajax_action_read_subfolders' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.15. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform limited path traversal to view directories and subdirectories in WordPress. Files cannot be viewed.
