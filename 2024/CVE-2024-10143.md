### Description

The MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies WordPress plugin before 2.7.7 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
