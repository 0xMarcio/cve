### Description

LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system.

This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, compromising their accounts and enabling unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.
