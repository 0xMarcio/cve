### Description

The Uncode theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘mle-description’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
