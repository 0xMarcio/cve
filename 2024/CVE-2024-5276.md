### Description

A SQL Injection vulnerability in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow allows an attacker to modify application data.  Likely impacts include creation of administrative users and deletion or modification of data in the application database. Data exfiltration via SQL injection is not possible using this vulnerability. Successful unauthenticated exploitation requires a Workflow system with anonymous access enabled, otherwise an authenticated user is required. This issue affects all versions of FileCatalyst Workflow from 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier.
