### Description

The adBuddy+ (AdBlocker Detection) by NetfunkDesign WordPress plugin through 1.1.3 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
