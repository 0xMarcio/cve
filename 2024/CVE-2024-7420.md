### Description

The Insert PHP Code Snippet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the /admin/snippets.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate/deactivate and delete code snippets via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
