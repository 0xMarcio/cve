### Description

The DesignThemes Core Features plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the dt_process_imported_file function in all versions up to, and including, 4.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.
