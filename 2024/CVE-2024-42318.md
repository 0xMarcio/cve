### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:landlock: Don't lose track of restrictions on cred_transferWhen a process' cred struct is replaced, this _almost_ always invokesthe cred_prepare LSM hook; but in one special case (whenKEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT updates the parent's credentials), thecred_transfer LSM hook is used instead.  Landlock only implements thecred_prepare hook, not cred_transfer, so KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT causesall information on Landlock restrictions to be lost.This basically means that a process with the ability to use the fork()and keyctl() syscalls can get rid of all Landlock restrictions onitself.Fix it by adding a cred_transfer hook that does the same thing as theexisting cred_prepare hook. (Implemented by having hook_cred_prepare()call hook_cred_transfer() so that the two functions are less likely toaccidentally diverge in the future.)
