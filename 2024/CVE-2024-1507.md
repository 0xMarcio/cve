### Description

The Prime Slider â€“ Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'title_tags' attribute of the Rubix widget in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
