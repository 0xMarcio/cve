### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ext4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replayThis mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd ("ext4: remove redundantmb_regenerate_buddy()") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based oncode in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as freeblocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of thebuddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.
