### Description

The Brizy â€“ Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms intended for public use as another user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. On sites where unfiltered_html is enabled, this can lead to the admin unknowingly adding a Stored Cross-Site Scripting payload.
