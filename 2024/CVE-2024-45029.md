### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:i2c: tegra: Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safeOn ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to amutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug:	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:585	...	Call trace:	__might_sleep	__mutex_lock_common	mutex_lock_nested	acpi_subsys_runtime_resume	rpm_resume	tegra_i2c_xferThe problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock&dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later,rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies onmutexes, triggering the error.To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe,considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.
