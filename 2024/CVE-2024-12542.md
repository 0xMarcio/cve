### Description

The linkID plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check when including the 'phpinfo' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read configuration settings and predefined variables on the site's server. The plugin does not need to be activated for the vulnerability to be exploited.
