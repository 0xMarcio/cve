### Description

The ARMember â€“ Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.30. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied via the redirect_to parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
