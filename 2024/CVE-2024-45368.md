### Description

The H2-DM1E PLC's authentication protocol appears to utilize either a custom encoding scheme or a challenge-response protocol. However, there's an observed anomaly in the H2-DM1E PLC's protocol execution, namely its acceptance of multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses. This behavior deviates from standard security practices where a single, specific response or encoding pattern is expected for successful authentication.
