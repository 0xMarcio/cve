### Description

The Passwords Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'pms_save_setting' and 'post_new_pass' AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugins settings and add passwords.
