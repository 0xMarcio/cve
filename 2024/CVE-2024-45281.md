### Description

SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform allows a high privilege user to run client desktop applications even if some of the DLLs are not digitally signed or if the signature is broken. The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system to perform DLL related tasks. This could result in a high impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.
