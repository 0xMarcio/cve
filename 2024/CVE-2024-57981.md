### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference on certain command abortsIf a command is queued to the final usable TRB of a ring segment, theenqueue pointer is advanced to the subsequent link TRB and no further.If the command is later aborted, when the abort completion is handledthe dequeue pointer is advanced to the first TRB of the next segment.If no further commands are queued, xhci_handle_stopped_cmd_ring() seesthe ring pointers unequal and assumes that there is a pending command,so it calls xhci_mod_cmd_timer() which crashes if cur_cmd was NULL.Don't attempt timer setup if cur_cmd is NULL. The subsequent doorbellring likely is unnecessary too, but it's harmless. Leave it alone.This is probably Bug 219532, but no confirmation has been received.The issue has been independently reproduced and confirmed fixed usinga USB MCU programmed to NAK the Status stage of SET_ADDRESS forever.Everything continued working normally after several prevented crashes.
