### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:gve: guard XDP xmit NDO on existence of xdp queuesIn GVE, dedicated XDP queues only exist when an XDP program is installedand the interface is up. As such, the NDO XDP XMIT callback shouldreturn early if either of these conditions are false.In the case of no loaded XDP program, priv->num_xdp_queues=0 which cancause a divide-by-zero error, and in the case of interface down,num_xdp_queues remains untouched to persist XDP queue count for the nextinterface up, but the TX pointer itself would be NULL.The XDP xmit callback also needs to synchronize with a devicetransitioning from open to close. This synchronization will happen viathe GVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED bit along with a synchronize_net() call,which waits for any RCU critical sections at call-time to complete.
