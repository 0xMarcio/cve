### Description

The Import and export users and customers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the user agent header in all versions up to, and including, 1.26.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access and higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
