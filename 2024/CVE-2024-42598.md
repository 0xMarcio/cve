### Description

SeaCMS 13.0 has a remote code execution vulnerability. The reason for this vulnerability is that although admin_editplayer.php imposes restrictions on edited files, attackers can still bypass these restrictions and write code, allowing authenticated attackers to exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands and gain system privileges.
