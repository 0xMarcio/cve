### Description

The SEOPress â€“ On-site SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's social image URL in all versions up to, and including, 7.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied image URLs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
