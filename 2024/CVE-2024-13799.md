### Description

The User Private Files – File Upload & Download Manager with Secure File Sharing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘new-fldr-name’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
