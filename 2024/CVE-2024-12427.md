### Description

The Multi Step Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized limited file upload due to a missing capability check on the fw_upload_file AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.23. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload limited file types such as images.
