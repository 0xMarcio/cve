### Description

The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express â€“ Email Marketing, Newsletters, Automation for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a CSV import in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
