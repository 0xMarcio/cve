### Description

Mattermost versions 10.0.x <= 10.0.0 and 9.11.x <= 9.11.2 fail to properly query ElasticSearch when searching for the channel name in channel switcher which allows an attacker to get private channels names of channels that they are not a member of, when Elasticsearch v8 was enabled.
