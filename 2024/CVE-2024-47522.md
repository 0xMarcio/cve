### Description

Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, invalid ALPN in TLS/QUIC traffic when JA4 matching/logging is enabled can lead to Suricata aborting with a panic. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. One may disable ja4 as a workaround.
