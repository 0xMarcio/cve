### Description

An issue was discovered in Samsung Magician 8.0.0 on macOS. Because symlinks are used during the installation process, an attacker can escalate privileges via arbitrary file permission writes. (The attacker must already have user privileges, and an administrator password must be entered during the program installation stage for privilege escalation.)
