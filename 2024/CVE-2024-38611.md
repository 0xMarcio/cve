### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtinUsing __exit for the remove function results in the remove callbackbeing discarded with CONFIG_VIDEO_ET8EK8=y. When such a device getsunbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removedwithout the cleanup being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fixit by compiling in the remove callback unconditionally.This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:	WARNING: modpost: drivers/media/i2c/et8ek8/et8ek8: section mismatch in reference: et8ek8_i2c_driver+0x10 (section: .data) -> et8ek8_remove (section: .exit.text)
