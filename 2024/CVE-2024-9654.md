### Description

The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Authorization in versions 3.1 through 3.3.4. This is due to a lack of sufficient validation checks within the 'verify_guest_email' function to ensure the requesting user is the intended recipient of the purchase receipt. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and view the receipts of other users, which contains a link to download paid content. Successful exploitation requires knowledge of another customers email address as well as the file ID of the content they purchased.
