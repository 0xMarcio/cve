### Description

An issue was discovered in Appsmith before 1.52. An incorrectly configured PostgreSQL instance in the Appsmith image leads to remote command execution inside the Appsmith Docker container. The attacker must be able to access Appsmith, login to it, create a datasource, create a query against that datasource, and execute that query.
