### Description

The WordPress Infinite Scroll â€“ Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ajax_load_more shortcode in versions up to, and including, 7.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
