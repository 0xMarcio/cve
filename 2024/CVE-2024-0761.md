### Description

The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.1 due to insufficient randomness in the backup filenames, which use a timestamp plus 4 random digits. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, to extract sensitive data including site backups in configurations where the .htaccess file in the directory does not block access.
