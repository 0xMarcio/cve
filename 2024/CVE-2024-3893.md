### Description

The Classified Listing â€“ Classified ads & Business Directory Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the rtcl_fb_gallery_image_delete AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.10.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachements.
