### Description

gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The links page (`links.html`) appends the `src` GET parameter (`[0]`) in all of its links for 1-click previews. The context in which `src` is being appended is `innerHTML` (`[1]`), which will insert the text as HTML. Commit 3b3d5b033aac3a019af64f83dec84f70ed2c8aba contains a patch for the issue.
