### Description

Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLSclients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memoryaddress resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial ofservice.Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checkingserver certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address whencomparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of anX.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates theapplication program.Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is notaffected, the denial of service can occur only when the application alsospecifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, theygenerally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expectedidentity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking thecertificate chain.  So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severityof the issue is Moderate.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
