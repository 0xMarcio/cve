### Description

The Image Optimization by Optimole – Lazy Load, CDN, Convert WebP & AVIF plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘allow_meme_types’ function in versions up to, and including, 3.12.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
