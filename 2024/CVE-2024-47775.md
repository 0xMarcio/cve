### Description

GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been found in the parse_ds64 function within gstwavparse.c. The parse_ds64 function does not check that the buffer buf contains sufficient data before attempting to read from it, doing multiple GST_READ_UINT32_LE operations without performing boundary checks. This can lead to an OOB-read when buf is smaller than expected. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
