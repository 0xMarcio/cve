### Description

The CRUDDIY project is vulnerable to shell command injection via sending a crafted POST request to the application server.Â The exploitation risk is limited since CRUDDIY is meant to be launched locally. Nevertheless, a user with the project running on their computer might visit a website which would send such a malicious request to the locally launched server.
