### Description

Insufficient argument checking in Secure state Entry functions in software using Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE), that has been compiled using toolchains that implement 'Arm v8-M Security Extensions Requirements on Development Tools' prior to version 1.4, allows an attacker to pass values to Secure state that are out of range for types smaller than 32-bits. Out of range values might lead to incorrect operations in secure state.
