### Description

facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, when a user updates their profile, a POST request containing user information is sent to the endpoint server/fm-modules/facileManager/ajax/processPost.php. It was found that non-admins can arbitrarily set their permissions and grant their non-admin accounts with super user privileges.
