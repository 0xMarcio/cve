### Description

Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. A crash was observed in `EnvoyQuicServerStream::OnInitialHeadersComplete()` with following call stack. It is a use-after-free caused by QUICHE continuing push request headers after `StopReading()` being called on the stream. As after `StopReading()`, the HCM's `ActiveStream` might have already be destroyed and any up calls from QUICHE could potentially cause use after free.
