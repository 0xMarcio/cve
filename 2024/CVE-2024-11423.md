### Description

The Ultimate Gift Cards for WooCommerce â€“ Create WooCommerce Gift Cards, Gift Vouchers, Redeem & Manage Digital Gift Coupons. Offer Gift Certificates, Schedule Gift Cards, and Use Advance Coupons With Personalized Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several REST API endpoints such as /wp-json/gifting/recharge-giftcard in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to recharge a gift card balance, without making a payment along with reducing gift card balances without purchasing anything.
