### Description

The Enfold theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check in avia-export-class.php in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export all avia settings which may included sensitive information such as the Mailchimp API Key, reCAPTCHA Secret Key, or Envato private token if they are set.
