### Description

The Relais 2FA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to incorrect authentication and capability checking in the 'rl_do_ajax' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.
