### Description

The Classified Listing â€“ Classified ads & Business Directory Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions like export_forms(), import_forms(), update_fb_options(), and many more in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to modify forms and various other settings.
