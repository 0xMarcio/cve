### Description

The Builder Shortcode Extras â€“ WordPress Shortcodes Collection to Save You Time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via the 'bse-elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private and draft posts created with Elementor that they should not have access to.
