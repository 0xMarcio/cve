### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sourcesThe current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of eachdescriptor at traversing for clock descriptors.  That is, when adevice provides a bogus descriptor with a shorter bLength, the drivermight hit out-of-bounds reads.For addressing it, this patch adds sanity checks to the validatorfunctions for the clock descriptor traversal.  When the descriptorlength is shorter than expected, it's skipped in the loop.For the clock source and clock multiplier descriptors, we can justcheck bLength against the sizeof() of each descriptor type.OTOH, the clock selector descriptor of UAC2 and UAC3 has an arrayof bNrInPins elements and two more fields at its tail, hence thosehave to be checked in addition to the sizeof() check.
