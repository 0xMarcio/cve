### Description

There is a stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in Esri Portal for ArcGIS Enterprise versions 11.1 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker to create a crafted link that is stored in the Layer Showcase application configuration which when clicked could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victimâ€™s browser.  The privileges required to execute this attack are high.  The attack could disclose a privileged token which may result in the attacker gaining full control of the Portal.
