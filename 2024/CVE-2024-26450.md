### Description

An issue exists within Piwigo before v.14.2.0 allowing a malicious user to take over the application. This exploit involves chaining a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability to issue a Stored Cross Site Scripting payload stored within an Admin user's dashboard, executing remote JavaScript. This can be used to upload a new PHP file under an administrator and directly call that file from the victim's instance to connect back to a malicious listener.
