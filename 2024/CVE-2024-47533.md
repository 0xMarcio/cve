### Description

Cobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments, has an improper authentication vulnerability starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7. `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows anyone to connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `''` password `-1` and make any changes. This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.
