### Description

VNote is a note-taking platform. Prior to 3.18.1, a code execution vulnerability existed in VNote, which allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the victim's system. A crafted URI can be used in a note to perform this attack using file:/// as a link. For example, file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating and sharing specially crafted notes. An attacker could send a crafted note file and perform further attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.18.1.
