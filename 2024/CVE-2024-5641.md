### Description

The One Click Order Re-Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ced_ocor_save_general_setting' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change the plugin settings, including adding stored cross-site scripting.
