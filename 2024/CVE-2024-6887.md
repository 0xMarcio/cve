### Description

The Giveaways and Contests by RafflePress  WordPress plugin before 1.12.16 does not sanitise and escape some of its Giveaways settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editor and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
