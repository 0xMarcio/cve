### Description

The Rover IDX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.0.2905. This is due to insufficient validation and capability check on the 'rover_idx_refresh_social_callback' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906.
