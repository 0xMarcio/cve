### Description

In function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer thatmay be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.Hence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointerdereferencing later in the code.To fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memoryallocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directlyreturn -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.
