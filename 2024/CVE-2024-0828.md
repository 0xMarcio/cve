The Play.ht â€“ Make Your Blog Posts Accessible With Text to Speech Audio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of functionality due to a missing capability check on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to delete, retrieve, or modify post metadata, retrieve posts contents of protected posts, modify conversion data and delete article audio.
