### Description

Strapi is an open-source content management system. By combining two vulnerabilities (an `Open Redirect` and `session token sent as URL query parameter`) in @strapi/plugin-users-permissions before version 4.24.2, is its possible of an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and retrieve the 3rd party tokens. The attack requires user interaction (one click). Unauthenticated attackers can leverage two vulnerabilities to obtain an 3rd party token and the bypass authentication of Strapi apps. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-users-permissions to version 4.24.2 to receive a patch.
