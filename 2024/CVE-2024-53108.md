### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/amd/display: Adjust VSDB parser for replay featureAt some point, the IEEE ID identification for the replay check in theAMD EDID was added. However, this check causes the followingout-of-bounds issues when using KASAN:[   27.804016] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in amdgpu_dm_update_freesync_caps+0xefa/0x17a0 [amdgpu][   27.804788] Read of size 1 at addr ffff8881647fdb00 by task systemd-udevd/383...[   27.821207] Memory state around the buggy address:[   27.821215]  ffff8881647fda00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[   27.821224]  ffff8881647fda80: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[   27.821234] >ffff8881647fdb00: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc[   27.821243]                    ^[   27.821250]  ffff8881647fdb80: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc[   27.821259]  ffff8881647fdc00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[   27.821268] ==================================================================This is caused because the ID extraction happens outside of the range ofthe edid lenght. This commit addresses this issue by considering theamd_vsdb_block size.(cherry picked from commit b7e381b1ccd5e778e3d9c44c669ad38439a861d8)
