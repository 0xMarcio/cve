### Description

The Bit File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in versions 6.0 to 6.5.5 via the 'checkSyntax' function. This is due to writing a temporary file to a publicly accessible directory before performing file validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server if an administrator has allowed Guest User read permissions.
