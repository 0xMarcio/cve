### Description

Multiple LDAP injections vulnerabilities exist in SecurEnvoy MFA before 9.4.514 due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exfiltrate data from Active Directory through blind LDAP injection attacks against the DESKTOP service exposed on the /secserver HTTP endpoint. This may include ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, which has a cleartext password for the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) feature.
