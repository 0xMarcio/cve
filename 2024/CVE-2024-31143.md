### Description

An optional feature of PCI MSI called "Multiple Message" allows adevice to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors.  Unlike for MSI-X,the setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in onego.  In this handling an error path could be taken in differentsituations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error pathwrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.
