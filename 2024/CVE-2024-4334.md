### Description

The Supreme Modules Lite – Divi Theme, Extra Theme and Divi Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘typing_cursor’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
