### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurswhen a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBsare sent from the pkt queue.The problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable, it isnents = max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) >> 4 + 1.Given the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small.Worst case, the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKBis added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad.At least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So, eventually the "skb_queue_walk loop"in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries. This makes sg_next returnNULL and this causes the oops.The patch sets nents to max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) * 2 to be able handlethe worst-case.Btw. this requires only 64-35=29 * 16 (or 20 if CONFIG_NEED_SG_DMA_LENGTH) = 464additional bytes of memory.
