### Description

Under certain conditions, a potential data leak may occur in the Traffic Management Microkernels (TMMs) of BIG-IP tenants running on VELOS and rSeries platforms. However, this issue cannot be exploited by an attacker because it is not consistently reproducible and is beyond an attacker's control.Â  Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated
