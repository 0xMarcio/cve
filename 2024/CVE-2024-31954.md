### Description

An issue was discovered in the installer in Samsung Portable SSD for T5 1.6.10 on Windows. Because it is possible to tamper with the directory and DLL files used during the installation process, an attacker can escalate privileges through arbitrary code execution. (An attacker must already have user privileges)
