### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issueIn the expression "cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count", both variables are u32values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integerwrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which alsocould potentially wrap.  The "cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)"multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on64bit systems.This patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition inuverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable "len" is onone side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modifiedall the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.
