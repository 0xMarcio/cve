### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:debugfs: fix wait/cancellation handling during removeBen Greear further reports deadlocks during concurrent debugfsremove while files are being accessed, even though the code inquestion now uses debugfs cancellations. Turns out that despiteall the review on the locking, we missed completely that thelogic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (andneed not wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we haveto trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can _never_get into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, andexplain it better while at it.
