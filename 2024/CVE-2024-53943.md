### Description

An issue was discovered in NRadio N8-180 NROS-1.9.2.n3.c5 devices. The /cgi-bin/luci/nradio/basic/radio endpoint is vulnerable to XSS via the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz name parameters, allowing an attacker to execute JavaScript within the context of the current user by injecting JavaScript into the SSID field. If an administrator logs into the device, the injected script runs in their browser, executing the malicious payload.
