When asked to both use a `.netrc` file for credentials and to follow HTTPredirects, curl could leak the password used for the first host to thefollowed-to host under certain circumstances.This flaw only manifests itself if the netrc file has an entry that matchesthe redirect target hostname but the entry either omits just the password oromits both login and password.
