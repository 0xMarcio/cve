### Description

Glossarizer through 1.5.2 improperly tries to convert text into HTML. Even though the application itself escapes special characters (e.g., <>), the underlying library converts these encoded characters into legitimate HTML, thereby possibly causing stored XSS. Attackers can append a XSS payload to a word that has a corresponding glossary entry.
