### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcountThe current implementation of the fpga bridge assumes that the low-levelmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointerto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it canlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the bridge ifthe parent device does not have a driver.To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_bridgestruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the function forregistering a bridge to take an additional owner module parameter andrename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for a helper macrothat automatically sets the module that registers the bridge as the owner.This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules andreduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting the owner.Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interfacefor registering an fpga bridge.Other changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get()to fpga_bridge_get() and of_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity sincethe bridge device is taken in these functions.
