### Description

The WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment & job listings | WooCommerce CRM & Accounting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the erp/v1/accounting/v1/transactions/sales REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied status and customer_id parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with accounting manager or admin privileges and higher to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
