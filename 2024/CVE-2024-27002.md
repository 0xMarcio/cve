### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:clk: mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probemt8183-mfgcfg has a mutual dependency with genpd during the probingstage, which leads to a deadlock in the following call stack:CPU0:  genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lockgenpd_power_off_work_fn() genpd_lock() generic_pm_domain::power_off()    clk_unprepare()      clk_prepare_lock()CPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lockclk_register()  __clk_core_init()    clk_prepare_lock()    clk_pm_runtime_get()      genpd_lock()Do a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sure clk_register()won't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifying mt8183-mfgcfg,do this on all mediatek clock controller probings because we don'tbelieve this would cause any regression.Verified on MT8183 and MT8192 Chromebooks.
