### Description

The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state. (CWE-280) Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x, do not handle invalid and missing permissions correctly, resulting in a denial of service. An adversary leverages a legitimate capability of an application in such a way as to achieve a negative technical impact.
