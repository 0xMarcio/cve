### Description

The Brizy â€“ Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file extension validation in the validateImageContent function called via storeImages in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.43. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Version 2.4.44 prevents the upload of files ending in .sh and .php. Version 2.4.45 fully patches the issue.
