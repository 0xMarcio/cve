### Description

The Event Tickets and Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'email' action in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to email the attendees list to themselves.
