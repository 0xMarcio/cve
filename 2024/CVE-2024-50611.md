### Description

CycloneDX cdxgen through 10.10.7, when run against an untrusted codebase, may execute code contained within build-related files such as build.gradle.kts, a similar issue to CVE-2022-24441. cdxgen is used by, for example, OWASP dep-scan. NOTE: this has been characterized as a design limitation, rather than an implementation mistake.
