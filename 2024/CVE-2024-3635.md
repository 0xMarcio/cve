### Description

The Post Grid  WordPress plugin before 7.5.0 does not sanitise and escape some of its Grid settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Editor and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
