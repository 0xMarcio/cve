### Description

The Gestpay for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 20221130. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ajax_delete_card' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the default card token for a user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
