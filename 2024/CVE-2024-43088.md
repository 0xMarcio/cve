### Description

In multiple functions in AppInfoBase.java, there is a possible way to manipulate app permission settings belonging to another user on the device due to a missing permission check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege across user boundaries with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
