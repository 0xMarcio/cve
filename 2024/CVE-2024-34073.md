### Description

sagemaker-python-sdk is a library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. In affected versions the capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module allows for potentially unsafe Operating System (OS) Command Injection if inappropriate command is passed as the “requirements_path” parameter. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity. This issue has been addressed in version 2.214.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not override the “requirements_path” parameter of capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils`, and instead use the default value.
