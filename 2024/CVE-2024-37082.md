### Description

When deploying Cloud Foundry together with the haproxy-boshrelease and using a non default configuration, it might be possible to craft HTTP requests that bypass mTLS authentication to Cloud Foundry applications. You are affected if you have route-services enabled in routing-release and have configured the haproxy-boshrelease property “ha_proxy.forwarded_client_cert” to “forward_only_if_route_service”.
