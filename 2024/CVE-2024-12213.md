### Description

The WP Job Board Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.76. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to supply the 'role' field when registering. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator on vulnerable sites.
