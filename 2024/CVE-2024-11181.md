### Description

The Greenshift â€“ animation and page builder blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 9.9.9.3 via the 'wp_reusable_render' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
