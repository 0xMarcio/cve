### Description

SAP NetWeaver AS Java (CAF - Guided Procedures) - version 7.50, allows an unauthenticated attacker to submit a malicious request with a crafted XML file over the network, which when parsed will enable him to access sensitive files and data but not modify them. There are expansion limits in place so that availability is not affected.
