### Description

The WP Compress â€“ Image Optimizer [All-In-One] plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the several functions in versions up to, and including, 6.20.01. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to edit plugin settings, including storing cross-site scripting, in multisite environments.
