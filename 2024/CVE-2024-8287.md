### Description

Anbox Management Service, in versions 1.17.0 through 1.23.0, does not validate the TLS certificate provided to it by the Anbox Stream Agent. An attacker must be able to machine-in-the-middle the Anbox Stream Agent from within an internal network before they can attempt to take advantage of this.
