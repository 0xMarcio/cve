### Description

The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeovr in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 via the updateUserInfo() due to missing validation on the 'openid' user controlled key that determines what user will be updated. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary user's accounts, including their email to a @weixin.com email, which can the be leveraged to reset the password of the user's account, including administrators.
