### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcountThe current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-levelmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointerto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it canlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the regionduring programming if the parent device does not have a driver.To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_regionstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions forregistering a region to take an additional owner module parameter andrename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helpermacros that automatically set the module that registers the region as theowner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modulesand reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interfacefor registering an fpga region.
