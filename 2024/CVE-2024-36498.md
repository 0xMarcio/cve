### Description

Due to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting attacks and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users.Â The "Edit Disclaimer Text" function of the configuration menu is vulnerable to stored XSS. Only the users Poweruser and Admin can use this function which is available at the URLhttps://$SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rdisclaimer+-apreThe stored Javascript payload will be executed every time the ScanWizard is loaded, even in the Kiosk-mode browser. Version 7.40 implemented a fix, but it could be bypassed via URL-encoding the Javascript payload again.
