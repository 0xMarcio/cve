### Description

Envoy is a high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy will crash when certain timeouts happen within the same interval. The crash occurs when the following are true: 1. hedge_on_per_try_timeout is enabled, 2. per_try_idle_timeout is enabled (it can only be done in configuration), 3. per-try-timeout is enabled, either through headers or configuration and its value is equal, or within the backoff interval of the per_try_idle_timeout. This issue has been addressed in released 1.29.1, 1.28.1, 1.27.3, and 1.26.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
