### Description

The Yoast SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘display_name’ author meta in all versions up to, and including, 22.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
