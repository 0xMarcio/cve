### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:irqchip/gic-v4: Don't allow a VMOVP on a dying VPEKunkun Jiang reported that there is a small window of opportunity foruserspace to force a change of affinity for a VPE while the VPE has alreadybeen unmapped, but the corresponding doorbell interrupt still visible in/proc/irq/.Plug the race by checking the value of vmapp_count, which tracks whetherthe VPE is mapped ot not, and returning an error in this case.This involves making vmapp_count common to both GICv4.1 and its v4.0ancestor.
