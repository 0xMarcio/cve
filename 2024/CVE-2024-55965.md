### Description

An issue was discovered in Appsmith before 1.51. Users invited as "App Viewer" incorrectly have access to development information of a workspace (specifically, a list of datasources in a workspace they're a member of). This information disclosure does not expose sensitive data in the datasources, such as database passwords and API Keys.
