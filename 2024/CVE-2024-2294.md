### Description

The Backuply â€“ Backup, Restore, Migrate and Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7 via the backup_name parameter in the backuply_download_backup function. This makes it possible for attackers to have an account with only activate_plugins capability to access arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. This only impacts sites hosted on Windows servers.
