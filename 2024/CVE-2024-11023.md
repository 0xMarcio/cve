### Description

Firebase JavaScript SDK utilizes a "FIREBASE_DEFAULTS" cookie to store configuration data, including an "_authTokenSyncURL" field used for session synchronization.  If this cookie field is preset via an attacker by any other method, the attacker can manipulate the "_authTokenSyncURL" to point to their own server and it would allow an actor to capture user session data transmitted by the SDK. We recommend upgrading Firebase JS SDK at least to 10.9.0.
