### Description

The Dynamics 365 Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution and Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.23 via Twig Server-Side Template Injection. This is due to missing input validation and sanitization on the render function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.
