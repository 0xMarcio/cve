### Description

The HUSKY â€“ Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6.1 via the woof_messenger_remove_subscr AJAX action due to missing validation on the 'key' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to unsubscribe users from a product notification sign-ups, if they can successfully obtain or brute force the key value for users who signed up to receive notifications. This vulnerability requires the plugin's Products Messenger extension to be enabled.
