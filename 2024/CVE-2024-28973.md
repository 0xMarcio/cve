### Description

Dell PowerProtect DD, versions prior to 8.0, LTS 7.13.1.0, LTS 7.10.1.30, LTS 7.7.5.40 contain a Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability. A remote high privileged attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the storage of malicious HTML or JavaScript codes in a trusted application data store. When a high privileged victim user accesses the data store through their browsers, the malicious code gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application. Exploitation may lead to information disclosure, session theft, or client-side request forgery
