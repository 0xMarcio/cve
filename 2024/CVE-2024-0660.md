### Description

The Formidable Forms â€“ Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, Payment, Calculator Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change form settings and add malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
