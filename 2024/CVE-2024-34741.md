### Description

In setForceHideNonSystemOverlayWindowIfNeeded of WindowState.java, there is a possible way for message content to be visible on the screensaver while lock screen visibility settings are restricted by the user due to a logic error in the code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
