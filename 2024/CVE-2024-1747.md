### Description

The WooCommerce Customers Manager WordPress plugin before 30.2 does not have authorisation and CSRF in various AJAX actions, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to call them and update/delete/create customer metadata, also leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of escaping of said metadata values.
