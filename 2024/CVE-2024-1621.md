The registration process of uniFLOW Online (NT-ware product) apps, prior to and including version 2024.1.0, can be compromised when email login is enabled on the tenant. Those tenants utilising email login in combination with Microsoft Safe Links or similar are impacted. This vulnerability may allow the attacker to register themselves against a genuine user in the system and allow malicious users with similar access and capabilities via the app to the existing genuine user.
