### Description

The GPX Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to a missing capability check and file type validation in the gpxv_file_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
