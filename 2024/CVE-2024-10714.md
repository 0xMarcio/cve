### Description

A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version 3.83 allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by adding excessive characters to the end of a multipart boundary during file upload. This results in the server continuously processing each character and displaying warnings, rendering the application inaccessible. The issue occurs when the terminal shows a warning: 'multipart.multipart Consuming a byte '0x2d' in end state'.
