In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/sclp: Prevent release of buffer in I/OWhen a task waiting for completion of a Store Data operation isinterrupted, an attempt is made to halt this operation. If this attemptfails due to a hardware or firmware problem, there is a chance that theSCLP facility might store data into buffers referenced by the originaloperation at a later time.Handle this situation by not releasing the referenced data buffers ifthe halt attempt fails. For current use cases, this might result in aleak of few pages of memory in case of a rare hardware/firmwaremalfunction.
