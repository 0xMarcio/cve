### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:phy: ti: phy-omap-usb2: Fix NULL pointer dereference for SRPIf the external phy working together with phy-omap-usb2 does not implementsend_srp(), we may still attempt to call it. This can happen on an idleEthernet gadget triggering a wakeup for example:configfs-gadget.g1 gadget.0: ECM Suspendconfigfs-gadget.g1 gadget.0: Port suspended.

For USB peripheral only cases these both could be NULL.
