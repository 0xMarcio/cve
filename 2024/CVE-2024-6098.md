### Description

When performing an online tag generation to devices which communicate using the ControlLogix protocol, a machine-in-the-middle, or a device that is not configured correctly, could deliver a response leading to unrestricted or unregulated resource allocation. This could cause a denial-of-service condition and crash the Kepware application. By default, these functions are turned off, yet they remain accessible for users who recognize and require their advantages.
