### Description

beego is an open-source web framework for the Go programming language. Versions of beego prior to 2.3.4 use MD5 as a hashing algorithm. MD5 is no longer considered secure against well-funded opponents due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. Version 2.3.4 replaces MD5 with SHA256.
