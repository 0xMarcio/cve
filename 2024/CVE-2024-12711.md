### Description

The RSVP and Event Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several AJAX functions like bulk_delete_attendees() and bulk_delete_questions() in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.13. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete questions and attendees and for authenticated users to update question menu orders.
