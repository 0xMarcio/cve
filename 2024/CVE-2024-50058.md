### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() tooCommit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(), sothe commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after thatprotection, there is an unprotected "uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);"call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is thereason why we do not see lots of these reports.Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move thisdereference to the if too.I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130. Thanks.
