### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ALSA: seq: oss: Fix races at processing SysEx messagesOSS sequencer handles the SysEx messages split in 6 bytes packets, andALSA sequencer OSS layer tries to combine those.  It stores the datain the internal buffer and this access is racy as of now, which maylead to the out-of-bounds access.As a temporary band-aid fix, introduce a mutex for serializing theprocess of the SysEx message packets.
