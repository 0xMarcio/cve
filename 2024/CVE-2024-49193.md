### Description

Zendesk before 2024-07-02 allows remote attackers to read ticket history via e-mail spoofing, because Cc fields are extracted from incoming e-mail messages and used to grant additional authorization for ticket viewing, the mechanism for detecting spoofed e-mail messages is insufficient, and the support e-mail addresses associated with individual tickets are predictable.
