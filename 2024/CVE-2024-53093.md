### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nvme-multipath: defer partition scanningWe need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within thecontroller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO willwait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but thataction also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer thepartion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.
