### Description

The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation via Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.25 via the save() due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the emails and passwords of arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, which makes account takeover and privilege escalation possible.
