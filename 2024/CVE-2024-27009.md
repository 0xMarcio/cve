### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:s390/cio: fix race condition during online processingA race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause theonline process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistentstate. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online failwith return code ENODEV.The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives aftera wait for final device state completed, but before the result stateis evaluated.Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held betweendetermining final state and checking result state.Note that since:commit 2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")path verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot,resulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring.
