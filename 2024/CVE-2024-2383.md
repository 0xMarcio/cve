### Description

A clickjacking vulnerability exists in zenml-io/zenml versions up to and including 0.55.5 due to the application's failure to set appropriate X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy HTTP headers. This vulnerability allows an attacker to embed the application UI within an iframe on a malicious page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions by tricking users into interacting with the interface under the attacker's control. The issue was addressed in version 0.56.3.
