### Description

LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Port Settings" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "descr" parameter when editing a device's port settings. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code when the "Port Settings" page is visited, potentially compromising the user's session and allowing unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.
