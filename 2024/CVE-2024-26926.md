### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:binder: check offset alignment in binder_get_object()Commit 6d98eb95b450 ("binder: avoid potential data leakage when copyingtxn") introduced changes to how binder objects are copied. In doing so,it unintentionally removed an offset alignment check done through callsto binder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -> check_buffer().These calls were replaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(),so now an explicit offset alignment check is needed here. This avoidslater complications when unwinding the objects gets harder.It is worth noting this check existed prior to commit 7a67a39320df("binder: add function to copy binder object from buffer"), likelyremoved due to redundancy at the time.
