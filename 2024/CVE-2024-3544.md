### Description

Unauthenticated attackers can perform actions, using SSH private keys, by knowing the IP address and having access to the same network of one of the machines in the HA or Cluster group. This vulnerability has been closed by enhancing LoadMaster partner communications to require a shared secret that must be exchanged between the partners before communication can proceed.
