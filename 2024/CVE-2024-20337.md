### Description

A vulnerability in the SAML authentication process of Cisco Secure Client could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection attack against a user.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link while establishing a VPN session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser or access sensitive, browser-based information, including a valid SAML token. The attacker could then use the token to establish a remote access VPN session with the privileges of the affected user. Individual hosts and services behind the VPN headend would still need additional credentials for successful access.
