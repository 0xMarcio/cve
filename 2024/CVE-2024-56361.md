### Description

LGSL (Live Game Server List) provides online status for games. Before 7.0.0, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in lgsl. The function lgsl_query_40 in lgsl_protocol.php has implemented an HTTP crawler. This function makes a request to the registered game server, and upon crawling the malicious /info endpoint with our payload, will render our javascript on the info page. This information is being displayed via lgsl_details.php. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.0.
