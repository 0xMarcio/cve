### Description

Yubico YubiKey 5 Series devices with firmware before 5.7.0 and YubiHSM 2 devices with firmware before 2.4.0 allow an ECDSA secret-key extraction attack (that requires physical access and expensive equipment) in which an electromagnetic side channel is present because of a non-constant-time modular inversion for the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, aka the EUCLEAK issue. Other uses of an Infineon cryptographic library may also be affected.
