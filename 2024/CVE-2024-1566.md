### Description

The Redirects plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change redirects created with this plugin. This could lead to undesired redirection to phishing sites or malicious web pages.
