### Description

The Rapid Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cache Poisoning in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to plugin storing HTTP headers in the cached data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to poison the cache with custom HTTP headers that may be unsanitized which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting.
