### Description

In startNextMatchingActivity of ActivityTaskManagerService.java, there is a possible way to bypass the restrictions on starting activities from the background due to a logic error in the code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
