### Description

The Tutor LMS â€“ eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to insufficient sanitization of HTML input in the Q&A functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Student access and above, to inject arbitrary HTML onto a site, though it does not allow Cross-Site Scripting
