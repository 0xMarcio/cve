### Description

The Real Estate 7 WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting the roles allowed to be selected during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register a new administrative user account.
