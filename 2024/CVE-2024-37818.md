### Description

Strapi v4.24.4 was discovered to contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the component /strapi.io/_next/image. This vulnerability allows attackers to scan for open ports or access sensitive information via a crafted GET request. NOTE: The Strapi Development Community argues that this issue is not valid. They contend that "the strapi/admin was wrongly attributed a flaw that only pertains to the strapi.io website, and which, at the end of the day, does not pose any real SSRF risk to applications that make use of the Strapi library."
