### Description

The Print Invoice & Delivery Notes for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wcdn_remove_shoplogo' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to remove the shop's logo.
