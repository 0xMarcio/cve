### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:team: prevent adding a device which is already a team device lowerPrevent adding a device which is already a team device lower,e.g. adding veth0 if vlan1 was already added and veth0 is a lower ofvlan1.This is not useful in practice and can lead to recursive locking:$ ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1$ ip link set veth0 up$ ip link set veth1 up$ ip link add link veth0 name veth0.1 type vlan protocol 802.1Q id 1$ ip link add team0 type team$ ip link set veth0.1 down$ ip link set veth0.1 master team0team0: Port device veth0.1 added$ ip link set veth0 down$ ip link set veth0 master team0============================================WARNING: possible recursive locking detected6.13.0-rc2-virtme-00441-ga14a429069bb #46 Not tainted--------------------------------------------ip/7684 is trying to acquire lock:ffff888016848e00 (team->team_lock_key){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)but task is already holding lock:ffff888016848e00 (team->team_lock_key){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: team_add_slave (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:1147 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:1977)other info that might help us debug this:Possible unsafe locking scenario:CPU0----lock(team->team_lock_key);lock(team->team_lock_key);*** DEADLOCK ***May be due to missing lock nesting notation2 locks held by ip/7684:stack backtrace:CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 7684 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.13.0-rc2-virtme-00441-ga14a429069bb #46Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-debian-1.16.3-2 04/01/2014Call Trace:<TASK>dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:122)print_deadlock_bug.cold (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3040)__lock_acquire (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3893 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5226)? netlink_broadcast_filtered (net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1548)lock_acquire.part.0 (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:467 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5851)? team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)? trace_lock_acquire (./include/trace/events/lock.h:24 (discriminator 2))? team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)? lock_acquire (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5822)? team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)__mutex_lock (kernel/locking/mutex.c:587 kernel/locking/mutex.c:735)? team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)? team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)? fib_sync_up (net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c:2167)? team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)team_device_event (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2928 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2951 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:2973)notifier_call_chain (kernel/notifier.c:85)call_netdevice_notifiers_info (net/core/dev.c:1996)__dev_notify_flags (net/core/dev.c:8993)? __dev_change_flags (net/core/dev.c:8975)dev_change_flags (net/core/dev.c:9027)vlan_device_event (net/8021q/vlan.c:85 net/8021q/vlan.c:470)? br_device_event (net/bridge/br.c:143)notifier_call_chain (kernel/notifier.c:85)call_netdevice_notifiers_info (net/core/dev.c:1996)dev_open (net/core/dev.c:1519 net/core/dev.c:1505)team_add_slave (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:1219 drivers/net/team/team_core.c:1977)? __pfx_team_add_slave (drivers/net/team/team_core.c:1972)do_set_master (net/core/rtnetlink.c:2917)do_setlink.isra.0 (net/core/rtnetlink.c:3117)
