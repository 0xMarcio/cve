### Description

The PDF Flipbook, 3D Flipbookâ€”DearFlip plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via outline settings in all versions up to 2.3.52 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied data. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
