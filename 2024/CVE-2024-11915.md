### Description

The RRAddons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via the Popup block due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts that they should not have access to.
