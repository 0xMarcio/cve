### Description

The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.4.2 via the pm_messenger_show_messages function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read private conversations of other users.
