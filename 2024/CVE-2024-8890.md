### Description

An attacker with access to the network where the CIRCUTOR Q-SMT is located in its firmware version 1.0.4, could obtain legitimate credentials or steal sessions due to the fact that the device only implements the HTTP protocol. This fact prevents a secure communication channel from being established.
