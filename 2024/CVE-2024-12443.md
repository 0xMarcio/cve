### Description

The CRM Perks – WordPress HelpDesk Integration – Zendesk, Freshdesk, HelpScout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'crm-perks-tickets' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
