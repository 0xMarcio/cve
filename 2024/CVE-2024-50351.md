### Description

LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "section" parameter of the "logs" tab of a device allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious "section" parameter, potentially compromising their session and enabling unauthorized actions. The issue arises from a lack of sanitization in the "report_this()" function. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.
