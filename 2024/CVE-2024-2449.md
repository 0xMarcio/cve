### Description

A cross-site request forgery vulnerability has been identified in LoadMaster.Â  It is possible for a malicious actor, who has prior knowledge of the IP or hostname of a specific LoadMaster, to direct an authenticated LoadMaster administrator to a third-party site. In such a scenario, the CSRF payload hosted on the malicious site would execute HTTP transactions on behalf of the LoadMaster administrator.
