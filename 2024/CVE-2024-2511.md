### Description

Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unboundedmemory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessionsImpact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to triggerunbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of ServiceThis problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option isbeing used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the defaultanti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, thesession cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properlyas it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. Amalicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure toforce a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLSclients.The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.
