### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, an authenticated user could run risky commands using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands in the Analytics Workspace. The vulnerability requires the authenticated user to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The authenticated user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.
