### Description

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in gradio-app/gradio allows attackers to upload multiple large files to a victim's system if they are running Gradio locally. By crafting a malicious HTML page that triggers an unauthorized file upload to the victim's server, an attacker can deplete the system's disk space, potentially leading to a denial of service. This issue affects the file upload functionality as implemented in gradio/routes.py.
