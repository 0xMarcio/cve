### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:interconnect: Don't access req_list while it's being manipulatedThe icc_lock mutex was split into separate icc_lock and icc_bw_lockmutexes in [1] to avoid lockdep splats. However, this didn't adequatelyprotect access to icc_node::req_list.The icc_set_bw() function will eventually iterate over req_list whileonly holding icc_bw_lock, but req_list can be modified while onlyholding icc_lock. This causes races between icc_set_bw(), of_icc_get(),and icc_put().Example A:  CPU0                               CPU1  ----                               ----  icc_set_bw(path_a)    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);                                     icc_put(path_b)                                       mutex_lock(&icc_lock);    aggregate_requests()      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...                                       hlist_del(...        <r = invalid pointer>Example B:  CPU0                               CPU1  ----                               ----  icc_set_bw(path_a)    mutex_lock(&icc_bw_lock);                                     path_b = of_icc_get()                                       of_icc_get_by_index()                                         mutex_lock(&icc_lock);                                         path_find()                                           path_init()    aggregate_requests()      hlist_for_each_entry(r, ...                                             hlist_add_head(...        <r = invalid pointer>Fix this by ensuring icc_bw_lock is always held before manipulatingicc_node::req_list. The additional places icc_bw_lock is held don'tperform any memory allocations, so we should still be safe from theoriginal lockdep splats that motivated the separate locks.[1] commit af42269c3523 ("interconnect: Fix locking for runpm vs reclaim")
