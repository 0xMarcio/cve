### Description

The RomethemeKit For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_options and reset_widgets functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify plugin settings or reset plugin widgets to their default state (all enabled). NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.5.3.
