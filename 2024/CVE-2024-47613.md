### Description

GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` within `gstgdkpixbufdec.c`. This function invokes `memcpy`, using `out_pix` as the destination address. `out_pix` is expected to point to the frame 0 from the frame structure, which is read from the input file. However, in certain situations, it can points to a NULL frame, causing the subsequent call to `memcpy` to attempt writing to the null address (0x00), leading to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
