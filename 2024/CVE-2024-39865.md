### Description

A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Remote Connect Server (All versions < V3.2 SP1). The affected application allows users to upload encrypted backup files. As part of this backup, files can be restored without correctly checking the path of the restored file. This could allow an attacker with access to the backup encryption key to upload malicious files, that could potentially lead to remote code execution.
