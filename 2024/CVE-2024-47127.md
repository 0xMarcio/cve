In the goTenna Pro App there is a vulnerability that makes it possible to inject any custom message with any GID and Callsign using a software defined radio in existing goTenna mesh networks. This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to share encryption keys via QR scanning for higher security operations and update your app to the current release for enhanced encryption protocols.
