### Description

The MainWP Dashboard  â€“ WordPress Manager for Multiple Websites Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'posting_bulk' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
