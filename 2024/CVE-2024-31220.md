### Description

Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Starting in version 0.16.0 and prior to version 0.18.0, an attacker may be able to remotely read arbitrary files without authentication due to a path traversal vulnerability. Users who exposed the Sunshine configuration web user interface outside of localhost may be affected, depending on firewall configuration. To exploit vulnerability, attacker could make an http/s request to the `node_modules` endpoint if user exposed Sunshine config web server to internet or attacker is on the LAN. Version 0.18.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may block access to Sunshine via firewall.
