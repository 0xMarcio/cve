### Description

The Snippet Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized Shortcode Deletion due to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.6. Note that a nonce is used as authentication here, but the value is leaked. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete the plugin's Shortcodes.
