### Description

An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4. The web application inserts the access token of an authenticated user inside GET requests. The query string for the URL could be saved in the browser's history, passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the query string contains sensitive information such as session identifiers, then attackers can use this information to launch further attacks. Because the access token in sent in GET requests, this vulnerability could lead to complete account takeover.
