### Description

The Export All Posts, Products, Orders, Refunds & Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.3 via the exports directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data stored insecurely in the /wp-content/uploads/smack_uci_uploads/exports/ directory which can contain information like exported user data.
