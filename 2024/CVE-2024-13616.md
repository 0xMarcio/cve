### Description

The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS WordPress plugin before 1.7.2 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).
