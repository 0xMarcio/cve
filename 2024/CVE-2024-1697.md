### Description

The Custom WooCommerce Checkout Fields Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the save_wcfe_options function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
