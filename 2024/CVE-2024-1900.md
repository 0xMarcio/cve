### Description

Improper session management in the identity provider authentication flow in Devolutions Server 2023.3.14.0 and earlier allows an authenticated user via an identity provider to stay authenticated after his user is disabled or deleted in the identity provider such as Okta or Microsoft O365. The user will stay authenticated until the Devolutions Server token expiration.
