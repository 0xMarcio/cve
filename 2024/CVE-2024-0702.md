### Description

The Oliver POS â€“ A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several functions hooked via AJAX in the includes/class-pos-bridge-install.php file in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several unauthorized actions like deactivating the plugin, disconnecting the subscription, syncing the status and more.
