### Description

A command injection vulnerability in Dahua EIMS versions prior to 2240008 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via the capture_handle.action interface. The flaw stems from improper input validation in the captureCommand parameter, which is processed without sanitization or authentication. By sending crafted HTTP requests, attackers can inject OS-level commands that are executed on the server, leading to full system compromise.Â Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2024-04-06 UTC.
