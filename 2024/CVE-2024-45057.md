### Description

i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the dynamic generation of HTML fields prior to the 2.9 branch. The file located at `ieducar/intranet/include/clsCampos.inc.php` does not properly validate or sanitize user-controlled input, leading to the vulnerability. Any page that uses this implementation is vulnerable, such as `intranet/educar_curso_lst.php?nm_curso=<payload>`, `intranet/atendidos_lst.php?nm_pessoa=<payload>`, `intranet/educar_abandono_tipo_lst?nome=<payload>`. Commit f2d768534aabc09b2a1fc8a5cc5f9c93925cb273 contains a patch for the issue.
