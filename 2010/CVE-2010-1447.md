### Description

The Safe (aka Safe.pm) module 2.26, and certain earlier versions, for Perl, as used in PostgreSQL 7.4 before 7.4.29, 8.0 before 8.0.25, 8.1 before 8.1.21, 8.2 before 8.2.17, 8.3 before 8.3.11, 8.4 before 8.4.4, and 9.0 Beta before 9.0 Beta 2, allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended (1) Safe::reval and (2) Safe::rdo access restrictions, and inject and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving subroutine references and delayed execution.
