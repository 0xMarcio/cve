### Description

A path traversal vulnerability exists in httpdasm version 0.92, a lightweight Windows HTTP server, that allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the host system. By sending a specially crafted GET request containing a sequence of URL-encoded backslashesÂ and directory traversal patterns, an attacker can escape the web root and access sensitive files outside of the intended directory.
