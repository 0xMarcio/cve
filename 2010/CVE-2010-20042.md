### Description

Xion Audio Player versions prior to 1.0.126 are vulnerable to a Unicode-based stack buffer overflow triggered by opening a specially crafted .m3u playlist file. The file contains an overly long string that overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain, allowing an attacker to hijack execution flow and run arbitrary code.
