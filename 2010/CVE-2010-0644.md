### Description

Google Chrome before 4.0.249.89, when a SOCKS 5 proxy server is configured, sends DNS queries directly, which allows remote DNS servers to obtain potentially sensitive information about the identity of a client user via request logging, as demonstrated by a proxy server that was configured for the purpose of anonymity.
