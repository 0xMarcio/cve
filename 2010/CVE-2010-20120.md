### Description

Maple versions up to and including 13's Maplet framework allows embedded commands to be executed automatically when a .maplet file is opened. This behavior bypasses standard security restrictions that normally prevent code execution in regular Maple worksheets. The vulnerability enables attackers to craft malicious .maplet files that execute arbitrary code without user interaction.
