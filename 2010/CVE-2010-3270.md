### Description

Stack-based buffer overflow in Cisco WebEx Meeting Center T27LB before SP21 EP3 and T27LC before SP22 allows user-assisted remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted .atp file and then disconnecting from a meeting.  NOTE: since this is a site-specific issue with no expected action for consumers, it might be REJECTed.
