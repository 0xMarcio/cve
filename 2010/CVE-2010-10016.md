### Description

BS.Player version 2.57 (build 1051) contains a vulnerability in its playlist import functionality. When processing .m3u files, the application fails to properly validate the length of playlist entries, resulting in a buffer overflow condition. This flaw occurs during parsing of long URLs embedded in the playlist, allowing overwrite of Structured Exception Handler (SEH) records. The vulnerability is triggered upon opening a crafted playlist file and affects the Unicode parsing logic in the Windows client.
