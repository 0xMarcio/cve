### Description

The FoFiType1::parse function in fofi/FoFiType1.cc in the PDF parser in xpdf before 3.02pl5, poppler 0.8.7 and possibly other versions up to 0.15.1, kdegraphics, and possibly other products allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PDF file with a crafted PostScript Type1 font that contains a negative array index, which bypasses input validation and triggers memory corruption.
