### Description

RSA verification recovery in the EVP_PKEY_verify_recover function in OpenSSL 1.x before 1.0.0a, as used by pkeyutl and possibly other applications, returns uninitialized memory upon failure, which might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass intended key requirements or obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
