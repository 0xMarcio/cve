### Description

EasyFTP Server 1.7.0.11 and earlier contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in its HTTP interface. When processing a GET request to list.html, the server fails to properly validate the length of the path parameter. Supplying an excessively long value causes a buffer overflow on the stack, potentially corrupting control flow structures. The vulnerability is exposed through the embedded web server and does not require authentication due to default anonymous access. The issue was resolved in version 1.7.0.12, after which the product was renamed to UplusFtp.
