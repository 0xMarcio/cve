### Description

Steinberg MyMP3Player version 3.0 (build 3.0.0.67) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing .m3u playlist files. The application fails to properly validate the length of input data within the playlist, allowing a specially crafted file to overwrite critical memory structures and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability can be exploited locally by convincing a user to open a malicious .m3u file.
