### Description

Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a flood of fragmented UDP packets.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that it requires high bandwidth to exploit, and the server does not experience any instability.  Therefore this "laws of physics" issue might not be included in CVE
