### Description

Internet Explorer 5.01 SP3 through 6.0 SP1 does not properly determine object types that are returned by web servers, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an object tag with a data parameter to a malicious file hosted on a server that returns an unsafe Content-Type, aka the "Object Type" vulnerability.
