### Description

Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass zone restrictions by (1) using the NavigateAndFind method to load a file: URL containing Javascript, as demonstrated by NAFfileJPU, (2) using the window.open method to load a file: URL containing Javascript, as demonstrated using WsOpenFileJPU, (3) setting the href property in the base tag for the _search window, as demonstrated using WsBASEjpu, (4) loading the search window into an Iframe, as demonstrated using WsFakeSrc, (5) caching a javascript: URL in the browser history, then accessing that URL in the same frame as the target domain, as demonstrated using WsOpenJpuInHistory, NAFjpuInHistory, BackMyParent, BackMyParent2, and RefBack, aka the "Script URLs Cross Domain" vulnerability.
