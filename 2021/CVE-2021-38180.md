### Description

SAP Business One - version 10.0, allows an attacker to inject formulas when exporting data to Excel (CSV injection) due to improper sanitation during the data export. An attacker could thereby execute arbitrary commands on the victim's computer but only if the victim allows to execute macros while opening the file and the security settings of Excel allow for command execution.
