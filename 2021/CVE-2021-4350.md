### Description

The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated HTML Injection in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections on the wpfm_send_file_in_email AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails using the site with a custom subject, recipient email, and body with unsanitized HTML content.  This effectively lets the attacker use the site as a spam relay.
