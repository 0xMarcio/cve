### Description

The Orange Form WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in all of its AJAX calls, for example the or_delete_filed one which is available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users could allow attackers to delete arbitrary posts.The AJAX calls performing actions on posts also do not ensure that the post belong to them (or that they are allowed to perform such action on it)
