### Description

When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, or a derived formats, an Apache Ant build can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that leads to an out of memory error, even for small inputs. This can be used to disrupt builds using Apache Ant. Commonly used derived formats from ZIP archives are for instance JAR files and many office files. Apache Ant prior to 1.9.16 and 1.10.11 were affected.
