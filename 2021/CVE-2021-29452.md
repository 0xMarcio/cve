### Description

a12n-server is an npm package which aims to provide a simple authentication system. A new HAL-Form was added to allow editing users in version 0.18.0. This feature should only have been accessible to admins. Unfortunately, privileges were incorrectly checked allowing any logged in user to make this change. Patched in v0.18.2.
