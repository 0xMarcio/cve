### Description

Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to parsing of DWG files resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer and allows attackers to cause a denial-of service condition or read sensitive information from memory.
