### Description

The తెలుగు బైబిల్ వచనములు WordPress plugin through 1.0 is lacking any CSRF check when saving its settings and verses, and do not sanitise or escape them when outputting them back in the page. This could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change the settings, as well as add malicious verses containing JavaScript code in them, leading to Stored XSS issues
