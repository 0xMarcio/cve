### Description

The PPOM for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 24.0 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the ppom_settings_panel_action AJAX action, allowing any authenticated to call it and set arbitrary settings. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could lead to Stored XSS issues
