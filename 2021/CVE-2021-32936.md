### Description

An out-of-bounds write issue exists in the DXF file-recovering procedure in the Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.4) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.
