### Description

An issue was discovered in October through build 471. It reactivates an old session ID (which had been invalid after a logout) once a new login occurs. NOTE: this violates the intended Auth/Manager.php authentication behavior but, admittedly, is only relevant if an old session ID is known to an attacker.
