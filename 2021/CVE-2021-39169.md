### Description

Misskey is a decentralized microblogging platform. In versions of Misskey prior to 12.51.0, malicious actors can use the web client built-in dialog to display a malicious string, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS could compromise the API request token. This issue has been fixed in version 12.51.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
