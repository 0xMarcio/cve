### Description

The Meow Gallery WordPress plugin before 4.1.9 does not sanitise, validate or escape the ids attribute of its gallery shortcode (available for users as low as Contributor) before using it in an SQL statement, leading to an authenticated SQL Injection issue. The injection also allows the returned values to be manipulated in a way that could lead to data disclosure and arbitrary objects to be deserialized.
