### Description

The Rearrange Woocommerce Products WordPress plugin before 3.0.8 does not have proper access controls in the save_all_order AJAX action, nor validation and escaping when inserting user data in SQL statement, leading to an SQL injection, and allowing any authenticated user, such as subscriber, to modify arbitrary post content (for example with an XSS payload), as well as exfiltrate any data by copying it to another post.
