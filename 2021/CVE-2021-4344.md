### Description

The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking mishandling the use of user IDs that is accessible by the visitor. This makes it possible for unauthenticated or authenticated attackers to access the information and privileges of other users, including 'guest users', in their own category (authenticated, or unauthenticated guests).
