### Description

The User Registration, User Profiles, Login & Membership â€“ ProfilePress (Formerly WP User Avatar) WordPress plugin before 3.1.8 did not sanitise or escape some of its settings before saving them and outputting them back in the page, allowing high privilege users such as admin to set JavaScript payloads in them even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed, leading to an authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue
