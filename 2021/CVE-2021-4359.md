### Description

The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections and lacking a security nonce on the wpfm_delete_file AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete any posts and pages on the site.
