### Description

The Smooth Scroll Page Up/Down Buttons WordPress plugin before 1.4 did not properly sanitise and validate its settings, such as psb_distance, psb_buttonsize, psb_speed, only validating them client side. This could allow high privilege users (such as admin) to set XSS payloads in them
