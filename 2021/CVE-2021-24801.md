### Description

The WP Survey Plus WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in place in its AJAX actions, allowing any user to call them and add/edit/delete Surveys. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitization in the Surveys' Title, this could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues
