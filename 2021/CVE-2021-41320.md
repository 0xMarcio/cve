### Description

** DISPUTED ** A technical user has hardcoded credentials in Wallstreet Suite TRM 7.4.83 (64-bit edition) with higher privilege than the average authenticated user. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the password is not hardcoded (it can be changed during installation or at any later time).
