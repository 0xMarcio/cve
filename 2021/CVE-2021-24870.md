### Description

The WP Fastest Cache WordPress plugin before 0.9.5 is lacking a CSRF check in its wpfc_save_cdn_integration AJAX action, and does not sanitise and escape some the options available via the action, which could allow attackers to make logged in high privilege users call it and set a Cross-Site Scripting payload
