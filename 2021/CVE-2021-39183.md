### Description

Owncast is an open source, self-hosted live video streaming and chat server. In affected versions inline scripts are executed when Javascript is parsed via a paste action. This issue is patched in 0.0.9 by blocking unsafe-inline Content Security Policy and specifying the script-src. The worker-src is required to be set to blob for the video player.
