### Description

An out-of-bounds write issue exists in the DGN file-reading procedure in the Drawings SDK (Version 2022.4 and prior) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition or execute code in the context of the current process.
