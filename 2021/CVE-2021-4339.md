### Description

The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check in the "ulisting/includes/route.php" file on the /1/api/ulisting-user/search REST-API route in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the list of all users and their email address in the database.
