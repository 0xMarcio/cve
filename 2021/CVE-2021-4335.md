### Description

The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access to data and modification of plugin settings due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX functions in versions up to, and including, 4.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions to modify plugin settings, including retrieving arbitrary order information or creating/updating/deleting products, orders, or other sensitive information not associated with their own account.
