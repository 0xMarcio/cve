### Description

The W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin before 2.1.4 was vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) security vulnerability within the "extension" parameter in the Extensions dashboard, which is output in an attribute without being escaped first. This could allow an attacker, who can convince an authenticated admin into clicking a link, to run malicious JavaScript within the user's web browser, which could lead to full site compromise.
