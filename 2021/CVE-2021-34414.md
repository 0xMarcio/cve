### Description

The network proxy page on the web portal for the Zoom on-premise Meeting Connector Controller before version 4.6.348.20201217, Zoom on-premise Meeting Connector MMR before version 4.6.348.20201217, Zoom on-premise Recording Connector before version 3.8.42.20200905, Zoom on-premise Virtual Room Connector before version 4.4.6620.20201110, and Zoom on-premise Virtual Room Connector Load Balancer before version 2.5.5495.20210326 fails to validate input sent in requests to update the network proxy configuration, which could lead to remote command injection on the on-premise image by a web portal administrator.
