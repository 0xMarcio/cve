### Description

Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle has a feature to add a registration form to both the Elementor and Beaver Builder page builders functionality. As part of the registration form, administrators can choose which role to set as the default for users upon registration. This field is hidden from view for lower-level users, however, they can still supply the user_role parameter to update the default role for registration.
