### Description

The Essential Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to and including 4.6.4 due to missing capability checks and nonce disclosure. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to perform many unauthorized actions such as changing settings and installing arbitrary plugins.
