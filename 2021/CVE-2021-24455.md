The Tutor LMS â€“ eLearning and online course solution WordPress plugin before 1.9.2 did not escape the Summary field of Announcements (when outputting it in an attribute), which can be created by users as low as Tutor Instructor. This lead to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue, which is triggered when viewing the Announcements list, and could result in privilege escalation when viewed by an admin.
