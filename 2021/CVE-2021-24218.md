### Description

The wp_ajax_save_fbe_settings and wp_ajax_delete_fbe_settings AJAX actions of the Facebook for WordPress plugin before 3.0.4 were vulnerable to CSRF due to a lack of nonce protection. The settings in the saveFbeSettings function had no sanitization allowing for script tags to be saved.
