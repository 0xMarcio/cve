### Description

An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, attackers can cause a calculation of the size of calls to memset in op_fnj3 in sr_port/op_fnj3.c to result in an extremely large value in order to cause a segmentation fault and crash the application.
