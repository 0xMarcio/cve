### Description

An out-of-bounds read issue exists in the DWG file-recovering procedure in the Drawings SDK (All versions prior to 2022.5) resulting from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer and allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service condition or read sensitive information from memory locations.
