Navigate to the Upload window3. Upload an image file, then capture the request4. Edit the request contents with a malicious file (webshell)5. Enter the path of file uploaded on URL - Remote Code Execution**Note:** Prevention for bad extensions can be done by using a whitelist in the config file(lfm.php). Corresponding document can be found in [here](https://unisharp.github.io/laravel-filemanager/configfolder-categories).
