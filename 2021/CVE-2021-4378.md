### Description

The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions like subscribers, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
