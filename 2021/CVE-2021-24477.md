### Description

The Migrate Users WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not sanitise or escape its Delimiter option before outputting in a page, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. Furthermore, the plugin does not have CSRF check in place when saving its options, allowing the issue to be exploited via a CSRF attack.
