### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrlIn hid_submit_ctrl(), the way of calculating the report length doesn'ttake into account that report->size can be zero. When running thesyzkaller reproducer, a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) tocalculate transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed tothe usb core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes.To fix this, first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zeroreport size case by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call itfrom hid_submit_ctrl().
