### Description

The FluentSMTP WordPress plugin before 2.0.1 does not sanitize parameters before storing the settings in the database, nor does the plugin escape the values before outputting them when viewing the SMTP settings set by this plugin, leading to a stored cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Only users with roles capable of managing plugins can modify the plugin's settings.
