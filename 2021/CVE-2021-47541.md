### Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/mlx4_en: Fix an use-after-free bug in mlx4_en_try_alloc_resources()In mlx4_en_try_alloc_resources(), mlx4_en_copy_priv() is called andtmp->tx_cq will be freed on the error path of mlx4_en_copy_priv().After that mlx4_en_alloc_resources() is called and there is a dereferenceof &tmp->tx_cq[t][i] in mlx4_en_alloc_resources(), which could lead toa use after free problem on failure of mlx4_en_copy_priv().Fix this bug by adding a check of mlx4_en_copy_priv()This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employsdifferential checking to identify inconsistent security operations(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that theinconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function orthe callers, so they constitute bugs.Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a falsepositive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewedthe bug.Builds with CONFIG_MLX4_EN=m show no new warnings,and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
