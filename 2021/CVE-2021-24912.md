### Description

The Transposh WordPress Translation WordPress plugin before 1.0.8 does not have CSRF check in its tp_translation AJAX action, which could allow attackers to make authorised users add a translation. Given the lack of sanitisation in the tk0 parameter, this could lead to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue which will be executed in the context of a logged in admin
