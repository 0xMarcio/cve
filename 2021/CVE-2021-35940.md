### Description

An out-of-bounds array read in the apr_time_exp*() functions was fixed in the Apache Portable Runtime 1.6.3 release (CVE-2017-12613). The fix for this issue was not carried forward to the APR 1.7.x branch, and hence version 1.7.0 regressed compared to 1.6.3 and is vulnerable to the same issue.
