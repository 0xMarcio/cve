### Description

Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) 1.4.0, when Profile Small is used, has incorrect access control. NSPE can access a secure key (held by the Crypto service) based solely on knowledge of its key ID. For example, there is no authorization check associated with the relationship between a caller and a key owner.
