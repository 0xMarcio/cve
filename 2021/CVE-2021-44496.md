### Description

An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, an attacker can control the size variable and buffer that is passed to a call to memcpy. An attacker can use this to overwrite key data structures and gain control of the flow of execution.
