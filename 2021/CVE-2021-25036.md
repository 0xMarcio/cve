### Description

The All in One SEO WordPress plugin before 4.1.5.3 is affected by a Privilege Escalation issue, which was discovered during an internal audit by the Jetpack Scan team, and may grant bad actors access to protected REST API endpoints they shouldnâ€™t have access to. This could ultimately enable users with low-privileged accounts, like subscribers, to perform remote code execution on affected sites.
